hey this is Jason with the local
locksmith company today today I'm
programming a key on a
2019 Ford F-150 and it has a proximity
key so we got a proximity key for
them and we're going to program this
proximity key this is all keys lost
however we'll program it and add a key
so that they don't have to add two I'm
going to flip around we're using the
allel the key goes inside the front cup
holder if you down in the bottom of the
front cup holder there's a
little little slot you have to remove
this cover you put your key in this slot
this is where you put your key to
program it or if the battery goes dead
it goes right
in and right out it's just a little slot
It just fits in there that's where you
put the key to program it or if the the
car battery goes the vehic the fob
battery goes dead so I'm going to go
back into my
computer and we're going to start
programming we're going to go into Ford
I tried to Auto detect it but this one
wouldn't Auto detect so we're going to
go manual
selection
Ford
USA this is an
F-150 and it's 2018 to
2020 and it's a smart key
there it says everything what it is okay
hit
yes and we're going to go into hot
function and we're going to go add smart
key
guided and then it's going to start hit
start okay there's no effectory alarm
going off so we're going to hit okay
this procedure will not erase any Keys
yes
it's normal for the instrument panel to
go black when performing this function
okay yes turn this the ignition on or
open and close the driver door one time
so we're going to open close the driver
door the alarm doesn't go off
okay so now it's going to go through and
perform its
uh bypass the security
system so it takes about 3 to 10 minutes
so I'm going to put you on pause until
that happens I'll be right
back okay we got through this security
accessing now it says how many learned
keys are there are two we hit okay it
says to place the smart key to be
learned into the slot which the slot for
that is right here in the front cup
holder that's where you learn the key or
you put the fob if you have a a dead
battery in your fob we'll hit okay now
it's learning the key the door should
cycle the door's just cycled learning
was successful do you want to learn
learn the next key no we are not
learning two keys we're only learning
one so we'll slap
no and that should be all we got to do
everything should be
done
Escape so now we'll get the smart key
out of the slot and we'll test the
key and then we'll
uh all
right
that works so we'll shut this we just
remote started it so doors lock and
unlock let's check the
alarm alarm works so this key is now

Transcript:
what's going on everybody today I'm
going to show you how to perform in all
keys lost for a newer Ford this is a
2018 Ford F-150 says smart key I'm going
to show you how to do the all keys lost
on the autel
im508 now I'm going to go ahead and get
to my Ford and load my vehicle info one
thing I would strongly recommend
is do not do all keys lost unless you
absolutely have to uh you can even if
you've lost all the keys you can just do
add a key uh the reason I'm doing this
is we've u reflashed a computer did a
parameter reset so we're going to go
ahead and do the all keys lost to
recognize the keys I'm adding
three one right here one right here and
a second here or a third here uh other
thing you want to take note of is where
the learning slot is for the smart key
on this vehicle we are looking at our
cup holder
you'll remove the little grommet there
and you'll see a little insert for the
key to go we can go ahead and take one
key place it in there like so and we'll
get started with our ignition on we're
going to go ahead and automatically read
the
VIN we'll select smart key
from here I'm going to go to control
unit keyless system key
learning now I'm going to go ahead and
select all smart Keys lost we will need
internet and it's telling us it's normal
for the instrument cluster to black out
and that it's going to delete the keys
so once we know that that's all going to
happen we'll select
yes and we'll see what entails sometimes
you get a 10 minute wait for security
access we do not have an active alarm so
we'll select
no so now what we're having here is the
nav screen has went out our cluster has
shut off that is completely normal
usually when I do this that it works but
what I'm going to do is go ahead and
pause the video until we get to our next
screen just so it doesn't take up 10
minutes of uh the same screen here so uh
I'll be back once it go ahead once it
configures a system and and we'll move
on okay we're about 3 or 4 minutes in
our nav screen has come back our gauge
cluster is on got some warning lights
see if I can show you here between the
steering wheel Hill start not assist
that stuff's normal to see it's just a
lack of communication with the
BCM and those lights will go away so
what it's saying here is we're going to
have to have two keys for clearing Keys
going to go ahead and hit yes
that's how many keys we have learned to
the vehicle it's going to erase
them now we have zero keys so we've got
our keys still in the learning
pocket insert key to be
learned we're going to hit okay and
we'll hear the door lock cycle
so there's our first
one go ahead and put that away going to
take our second
one hit
yes new key is in the
slot all right so we've got our second
key in the car should be good to to
start let's go ahead and add this third
key if I'm not mistaken this key has a
dead battery so there's a chance we
might have to open it up for it to get
some signal there I've had that happen a
lot so we'll go to the third one through
our
menus we'll see if it fails on this one
nope all right there we have it we've
got three keys learn to the vehicle
now see if we can get that lock cycling
try all
three and we're going to go ahead and
hit no on the autel let it close
out let's see if she
starts and you'll notice those error
lights about the hill assist have went
away so
there you have it guys that's how you do
an all keys lost with your autel im508
on the new or Fords it's a 2018 F-150
hope that helps thanks for your time

what's going on guys welcome back to the
channel
today we have this 2017
uh it's a ford f-150 and today we're
going to program a new key for this
truck so as you can see here i have
the original key
i'm going to use the
key that i want to program we already
actually cut this key
and
let me just show you that it doesn't
turn on the truck
so
what we're gonna use today to program
these two keys
um
we're gonna use the autel uh 608
so here we have the information already
pre-selected on this truck and now i'm
gonna take you we actually are gonna
need the first original key
to open the switch
and
we are going to
scan the immobilizer to see how many
keys we have programmed because you can
program uh only up to eight
and we should see only like four or two
already programmed so we have two
from the factory
uh we're gonna add a key
we're gonna select key guided automatic
we're gonna
start and it's gonna say if the factor
alarm is activated you need to
deactivate it first so
we don't have that activated so we're
getting uh press yes
and select yes
it is normal that the instrument cluster
is gonna flash sometimes because of the
programming function so we press insert
the key to be learned and turn the
ignition on so we're gonna remove the
key
and we're gonna insert the key we want
to
learn
we're gonna press okay
it's gonna enter the system and it's
gonna require about three to ten minutes
sometimes it takes less time but
let's just wait in and see what happens
okay so that was quicker than i thought
it took only a minute so we're going to
press ok
turn ignition off
we're going to press ok again
insert the key to mid learn and turn
ignition on
press ok learning key
and we successfully learned the key as
you heard the the log cycle and that
means the key is already programmed so
we don't want to program another key
we
we're gonna go back escape
and now we're gonna test the key
so we see here it's working
and now let's go i'm gonna test the
other one
so both keys work
and
now
let's rescan the system make sure we
have the key already programmed so we're
gonna do a mobilizer scan again
and let's just wait let's just wait for
codes probably i'm gonna have full court
no
we're good uh and now we have three keys
already programmed all right so this is
pretty much how you do it it's really
simple with this tool uh with other
tools takes like 10 minutes but with
this one
it's an amazing amazing tool a little
bit pricey but it's worth
buying this tool because you can do so
much work with this all right guys so i

programming a remote for this
2015 lifted Silverado HD
2500
Z71 with
our
trusty Advanced Diagnostics MVP Pro. So,
should be a lot of fun here, guys.
I'm going to climb up in the truck and

So, we go down to GM USA, go to
remote. You can go by vehicle.
Chevy,
Silverado,
2500,
2015. Some of the older models of this
you didn't need to plug in. You could do
some onboard programming. With newer
ones, you
cannot. We have the smart card, which is
up here. I don't know how much of this
you guys can see, but we're going to
just try it and find out. So, we hit
enter after we switch ignition on
So, you hold both buttons down for up to
8 seconds. You hear the beep, that means
it's done. Hit
enter. And that's it. We're
done. Turn it
off. Open the door up.
Now we got all the way around. Check the
remote
start. Remote start is
good. And that's how you program it with
a MVP advanced

key to it
as you can see theflight is on this key
is not programmed
we do have one existing key however in
this case we're going to clear all keys
in order to just have these two
programmed
to start we need to read the pin code go
to mobilization
gm usa
read security code bcm read pin code
yes we do want to read the pin must be
connected to the network which i am
this will pop up once more to read the
pin code in a second
read pin code
2049 is our pin

guys it's alex with all cars key
programming in all cars brotherhood uh
today we're going to be working on a 22
dodge ram 1500 uh we're going to be
adding a key to the system using the
auto pro pad
um
i'm going to go ahead and show you how
we get that done where we hook up
sorry guys so you can see here it's a
you're built 10 21 makes it a 22.
all right but uh we don't hook up here
in the obd area
uh we actually have to go onto the
passenger side so
i'll show you guys how to get there
all right so i kind of pulled it down so
you can just kind of get in there you're
going to hook up right where this black
cord is follow it over the top there
and uh we're going to be adding this key
here
as you can see it doesn't work
this is the
key that works
all right so
let's go ahead and get on this auto pro
pad
make sure you get the hazard lights on
before you get started
that way it can actually uh
find the car on the auto detect
automatically identify
now if this doesn't go through on
automatic you can just actually just go
manually
and get it done that way
as you see here it says 22 ram
see us
talks about the secret security gateway
plug
all right so i'm going to read the pin
it takes just a little bit
all right there it is four eight one two
four all right
all right
i'm gonna go ahead and read the number
of keys in the system there's two so
that's what i like to do i like to see
what number how many keys are in the
system before i get started so that way
if it fails i can actually just go back
and see if the key actually learned so
let me press ok i'm going to go to
program key
48124 it's already populated
all right hold down the start button on
the upper corner of the key
so i'm gonna go ahead and look for it
there
press the button
i'm just going to hold it down
c
let me see something real quick
let me go ahead and take out the actual
original key
because it doesn't look like it's going
through
let's take this original key out of the
car and that way it's not being seen by
that put it back here
the back of the bed normally i like to
keep them outside but i kind of forgot
and then let's start that over again
here we go
press it
that still will still be able to be seen
by the other the other key give me one
second
get a little further out
hopefully that'll work
all right let's start that over again
and let's press one more time here we go
two
two
c
i'm not getting anything on this key
[Music]
i'm not getting the thing here
[Music]
it's not seeing the foam at all
okay
maybe this one didn't go through give me
one sec we're going to start this over
again
all right guys we're back on this 22 uh
dodge ram and uh
obviously earlier we were trying to get
it to go
and it wasn't going so
what i ended up doing is i ended up like
reading the chip value or specific chip
value and it was off like
at least with the little the the mini
key tool
it came up as a
7953 mary
and the key i was trying to add in was a
7939 mary
which you know is different so
um i did find
uh another key that uh
had the 7953 mary and we're gonna go
with that um but the cool thing like i
said before like cool thing about this
is that we're
seeing that the auto pro pad is able to
communicate is able to read the pin
uh to see how many keys are in and it
wasn't the auto pro pad's fault that the
key wasn't being added
clearly it was because
the chip value is different you know so
here we're going to figure it we're
going to show you guys how to get it all
done
remember i like to write obviously see
the number of keys it says 2
and now we're going to go into program
key
yep
all right so it's going to tell me to
put the key to the start button and hold
it down
we'll do that now
let's see what that says
and program success
all right guys we're done now we're
gonna go see the number of keys
says three
all right so this key
definitely works
awesome all right guys so i just wanted
to show you guys that
um again if you guys are learning
anything

Title: Program Toyota Camry Key and Remote (also other Toyota and Scion vehicles too!)
Vehicle: Toyota Camry (2018-2024)

Category: Key Programming Tutorial

Transcript:
- So do you need a new car key
and remote for your Toyota Camry?
Well I've got a solution to you.
Tom's Key Company has come up with a way
that you can program these yourself
and save a lot of money over what dealer
and locksmith charge.
Welcome to Tomahawk DIY.
I'm Mike.
Let me show you how to do this.
You're gonna go to tomskey.com,
where you can buy the new key,
if you want one with a remote,
or you can buy one without a remote.
And then you're going to rent
Tom's Car Key Programmer,
this little box.
I'll send everything in the mail to you
that you need to take
care of this program.
It's really easy to do.
Let's take a closer look.
The first thing with the package
will come this little extension cable.
Find a little plug that looks like this.
Occasionally it might
have a cover over the end.
Take the extension cable,
that'll make it easier
to plug in Tom's Car Key Programmer.
With the extension cable plugged in,
we're ready to do this.
You gotta look around
and find where your blinking
red security light is.
In this Camry, it's here on the dash.
Sometimes it's up need the speedometer,
sometimes it's elsewhere.
With your new remote and
new key that I'll send you
through Tom's Key Company.
It's not gonna work at first.
So your security light, put it in,
security light keeps blinking.
That means there's not a valid key.
If we put our working key in,
see the light turns off,
the valid working key.
Light's blinking.
This key doesn't work.
Let's look at the remote.
Here's the working remote.
(beeping)
Unlocks the car.
Locks the car.
(car alarm)
Makes the alarm beep.
Everything's good.
If I take my one that
doesn't work, nothing works.
You're gonna take your working key.
On these Camry's, it's really
important to take a look
at the blade of the key.
Right here on factory original keys,
you'll see a letter.
In this case, it's a G.
Sometimes it can be a H,
sometimes it can be a little dot.
Some years it changes from
one symbol to another.
So you gotta be sure you're
using the right symbol.
That's the chip in your computer.
You're going to take your working key,
you have the new one you
want to program ready to go.
Let's put our new one up here.
Here's our working one.
We're gonna put it in, the
security light turns off.
You don't start the car,
just turn it two clicks
to the on position.
(beeping)
In the on position, you're
gonna slide this little switch.
I apologize this doesn't have the label,
but, when you receive
it, it will have a label.
One side says key, one side says remote.
Flip it over here to the key side.
Get our extension cable,
we're gonna plug it in.
This will start beeping
(beeping)
and we're gonna watch the
security light to turn solid red.
(beeping)
There it started beeping, watch the light.
(beeping)
Okay.
That means it's ready
to program the new key.
Take out the working key,
put in the new one.
See this is uncut.
Now it starts blinking.
It will now blink for 60 seconds.
It's important to watch
the blinking speed.
It should be about one blink per second
and then it turns off.
If it blinks faster than one per second,
that means your vehicle has
reached the maximum number
of keys that can be programmed.
You need more sophisticated equipment
to erase any keys that have been lost.
All right, here we go.
After 60 seconds,
it stops blinking.
This key is now programmed.
You can take it to a locksmith.
They'll charge you a
few dollars to cut it,
to match your existing key.
It's that easy.
The blinking light means
there's not a valid key
in the ignition.
If we put this existing one in,
the blinking light turns off.
Put this one in, blinking light turns off.
So there you have it, that's programmed.
All right, let's take a
look at doing the remote.
I do want to point out,
that process will work for
a regular key like this
without a remote.
I'll sell these on tomskey.com.
Programming the remote, equally easy.
We're gonna take our existing
working key, put it in,
turn it two clicks to the on position.
(beeping)
Have the programmer,
you're gonna slide it over to where it
will be labeled with remote setting.
We're gonna plug it in and
it's gonna start beeping.
(beeping)
I've got my new remote ready to go.
(fast beeping)
Okay, that beeping means open the door.
(long beep)
It'll change tones, you're
gonna push lock and unlock,
and then lock.
(long beep)
Just like that.
And you heard the car beep,
signaling that it's done.
We take out our existing
and unplug this.
And now I'll show you it locks, unlocks.
(car locking)
(car unlocking)
Turn on the alarm.
(car alarm)
(car unlocking)
(car locking)
The trunk button.
It all works.
It's that easy.
So there you have it.
You saw just how easy that was
to program with Tom's Car Key Programmer.

look around until you see the white obd2
plug sometimes it can be a different
color but usually it's white take the
cable plug it in
now the first thing you need to do is
make sure you have a master key
in order to do that look around find the
blinking red light in this 2018 camry
it's right here
it can be anywhere on the dashboard
sometimes it can be up above it can even
be over
here and on a few cars all the way over

by the way you might want to pick up one
of these tile devices to protect your
investment and keys it links to your
smartphone so you always know where your
keys are at they don't get lost so
confirm you have a master key
as we slide this in the ignition
watch the blinking red light it's going
to turn off immediately
that means we have a master key
if when you slide in your key this red
light turns on solid red for two seconds
you have a valet key and you won't be

settings
we'll turn it to the key setting
it's important for you to know there's
two things you have to do to program a
key one is program the chip
to release the immobilizer which will
let the engine start otherwise it
immobilizes the vehicle
the second thing you have to do is the
remote portion

and
unlock the car lock the car that kind of
thing we're going to do the key first
we're going to take our working master
key put it into the ignition

program you're going to take your new
key

take out the working key put this in in
the ignition don't push too hard but
just as hard just until it stays in
there
you'll see this start blinking now we've
got to wait 60 seconds
watch the blinking pattern it should be
a steady on off
if there's a different pattern like too
quick a pause and then three quick
it means there's a something else you'll
want to email help at tom's key you'll
know the key is programmed when this red
light stops blinking
okay it's getting close
there it stopped blinking
this key is now programmed to this
vehicle so once you get it cut it'll
start the engine you can check that it's
programmed and disconnect the programmer
by sliding it into the ignition
notice the red light went off
pull it out the red light's blinking
again
again be careful because this isn't cut
you don't want to push it too hard
just enough that it'll slip in and stay
you kind of feel it latch into place
now that we've got our new key
chip programmed we need to program the
remote buttons so they don't work right
now
here's the working one there's the one
with the tile you might want to pick one
of those up
press lock
check the alarm
unlock
it work open the door close the door
to do this procedure you want the doors
all closed with this door unlocked if

Title: AUTEL IM608 PRO HONDA CIVIC SMART KEY PROGRAMMING
Vehicle: Honda Civic (2016-2021)

Category: Key Programming Tutorial

Transcript:
[Music]
Hey, what's up? How's everybody doing?
Welcome to my channel, Mike's
Automotive. So, today we're working with
the Honda Civic, you guys. And this is
like 2016 and up for push to start. Now,
the customer had a auto universal remote
pro into the vehicle.
And the thing is that it was kind of
working. It turns on the car when it
wants to. It doesn't turn on. Sometimes
it does. So, she's like, "Hey, I'm just
going to get an OEM smart key and just
go ahead and program it." So, I said,
"All right." So, we're going to be using
our auto. Go ahead and make sure you
have your uh emergency lights on if you
can't turn it on. If you can turn it on,
turn it on. Okay. Now, um we're going to
go to automatic uh VIN scan. So, it's
going to automatically search for the
vehicle using the VIN. Um like I said,
if you can turn it on, turn it on. We're
going to select smart key.
We're going to do a push to start. Okay?
Because it's push to start.
Um, as you guys can see, there's
information right there for Civic.
Um, we're going to We always go through
MMO status scan just because it it does
the the scan of the MMO system and it
lets us know something's wrong with it
um or anything. So, it says is ignition
turned on by pressing the start button.
If you can turn it on, yes. If you can
press no.
So, um, we're going to go ahead and scan
it. You guys can see it has the smart
system on here and then the immo system.
So, the smart system would be like
anything that's keyless, any modules
that are that can pick it up, you know,
the immo system, of course, is the
immobilizer system that immobilizes a
vehicle if it's not the correct key. So,
um, we're going to go through all keys
lost. Actually, if you have a key, you
can go through add a key, but I'm going
to go through all keys lost because at
the end of the day, their key didn't
want to turn on the car and off when it
needed to. And this requires you to turn
on and off the car. So, it says to place
the key to be learned in the vehicle and
take all the other keys out.
Is the ignition turned on by pressing
on? Um, no. We can't turn it on. So,
we're going to press no. It says press
and hold the start button. So, we're
going to press and hold the start button
until the until the ignition uh turns on
and the cluster turns on and all the
lights, everything kind of like
accessory mode.
Um, is ignition switched on? Please
release the ignition. We're going to
press okay.
[Music]
Okay, here's the next step. whether it's
a newer model generally refers to after
2020. We're going to press no because
it's not over 2020. It's like 16 through
18.
Now it's establish establishing vehicle
communication.
Okay. Checking condition of the vehicle.
Please wait.
Keep program success. Would you like to
program the next one?
Press yes if you have another one. Press
no if you don't have another one. So
it's telling us to press the start
button.
Okay, to turn it off.
Now it says to turn it on. So basically
for all Honda, this is how it is. Turn
it off. Turn it on.
So you might have to um
Okay. Are both the keys
keyless? Is indicator immobilizer light
off? Yes, it's off. We're going to press
yes. Now again, it's going to tell us to
shut it off. So, we're going to press
it.
Now, it says to turn it on. Okay. Now,
now you're going to have to press it
twice to turn it on every time you press
it. So, press it twice to turn it off
and once, excuse me, press it twice to
turn it on and once to turn it off. As
you guys can see, the registration is
complete. Okay, turn it off. Press it
once to turn it off. Now, don't put your
foot on the brake, okay? Like, do not
start the actual vehicle. It just wants
you to put it in accessory mode. As you
guys can see, excuse me, it's
programmed. The remote works. Everything
works perfectly. Um, please don't forget

is programming a smart key to a 2016 and
up Honda Civic using our Autel IM 608

instructions here like making sure your
vehicle battery is good and charged turn
off your headlights your air
conditioning your heater your radio any
lights that are going to be drawing the
battery you don't want the battery to
drain while you're doing the programming
process
all right there's two steps to
programming your fob any fobs that came
in the box are going to require an
activation step
many times if you order additional fobs
that come separately they may not
require the activation step so let me
first show you how to go through the
activation you find your vehicle this
lookup table today we're doing a nissan
altima 2015
and we have the four button remote with
trunk
so
we need code 42.
the instructions will walk you through
everything you need to do the first step
is to press the top and the bottom
button at the same time
and you'll see a blue light that turns
on solid if you got a blue light like
that you know you need to go through
activation
now if you wait too long before entering
the code it'll time out and you have to
start over so be aware that many times
in this programming process steps are
time sensitive
let's get it ready to activate okay

that none of your key fobs are working
don't fare
the frequent last question tells you
what to do
programming nissan key fob starts
by racing all fobs now sometimes it goes
wrong and you find you'll have no
working fobs but take a deep breath and
don't panic there's an easy fix to get
the original key fob working again lets
you know right here that you have to go
through this procedure it depends if you
got stuck at step 13 or step 14. in our
case finish step 14
and so it tells us to hold the original
key
on the start button
for 15 seconds and go through that whole
procedure notice how this light is
flashing when pressed
so that tells us that it's still in
pairing mode release the start button
with the original key and then i'm going
to hold it there for about 15 seconds
and then i'm going to repeat this three
times
now watch for that security light
all right you're going to wait 15
seconds
turned
off notice this key registration
complete this key i'll start the vehicle
again
there we go and we can start over at
step one in the programming process the
trick is getting that security light
to turn on and blink five times
one other item i want to warn about in a
very rare but easy to fix situation
there are some push to start nissan
vehicles that have a fuse titled push
button start
if this fuse had been removed
or was burnt out before programming
begins your vehicle may seem like it
stops working the dashboard lights will
not illuminate
around the push button start there are
some letters the lock acc and on buttons
will not be illuminated to fix this you
simply replace this fuse to get your
original key fob working again and then
you can continue programming
now we also offer a full money back
guarantee so if you try this and it just
doesn't work for your vehicle
simply email help tomsky.com and we'll
provide a full refund when you send
everything back with the original
packaging that's it that's just how easy
it is to use this simple key programming
kit from tomsky.com

if you can use this I want to show you
how you can make a spare key for your

Tom's key company we've got one fob for
this 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee we're
going to make a spare key come to
tomskey.com where you can place your
order to get a programmer spare key sent
to you today it's important for you to
know you've got to have at least one
working key fob for your vehicle in
order for Tom's key company to help you
make a spare for your vehicle watch how
easy this is okay to get started we've
got one working key for this 2015 Jeep
Grand Cherokee and have a spare key here
the original is an oem with a Jeep logo
spare is an aftermarket which works just
great
so during programming you're going to
have to have your key fobs far enough
away from the vehicle so the only one
key is detected
so to do that you get out of the vehicle
and go find and set these uh inside the
house the other side of the garage make
sure they're far enough away
[Music]
and try and start the engine
it doesn't want to start
it's giving us an error
it can't detect the keys we can bring
the keys in one at a time
now we know where to set the keys so
they're far enough away that we can
program the new one
and here's the programming device first
thing you need to do is use your phone
scan download the app
with the app installed let's start
programming
going to come into key pairing here
first you need to scan the QR code on
this device it'll help it as it pairs
with your VIN number
make sure you get the QR Code by the
serial number right there
okay it warns you you need the internet
connection got to have all the keys that
you plan to pair as well as your
original keys and repairing tools so
let's get going
to come in and select our vehicle 2015
Jeep Grand Cherokee and it asks if that
looks like my original key yep
that key does look the same
okay we need to download a file for Jeep
let's get that going
now while we're waiting I'll let you
know the app will get better over time
so some of the steps may be a little bit
different when you perform the
programming process for your vehicle
so follow the instructions on the app it
should walk you through step by step
nice and easy
okay our Jeep data is installed
all right we've got to plug our
programmer into the OBD Port that's down
near the gas and brake pedal
come down here you're gonna have to look
around to find the port
that it fits into and plug it in
now you'll see it light up it's a little
hard to see the light
[Music]
so I'm going to use this extension cable
you can pick one of those up to make
your life a little bit easier
all right I've got this guy plugged in
and let's go ahead and hit next see the
green light
[Music]
okay we're going to scan for the
Bluetooth
okay the phone pulls up I see the same
serial number there and it's 284 so
let's try and pair it
should get a pairing request yep
okay
we're connected we saw light turn blue
it's connected now it's scanning it's
checking to make sure it's got the
current firmware in this device you may
find that the light turns red and it has
to update that's okay perfectly normal
all right there it's detected the new
version so it's disconnected
light went green blue we should turn it
red okay now it's updating the firmware
okay
great successful
we got to get this thing paired again
it's trying there
we're reconnected okay
hit next
all right we're up to date so
we're back out
may need to start the app over at this
point depending on your vehicle and
depending on how the update
took place
okay this one we don't need to count
down turn on the ignition within 30
seconds
pushed it twice
saw the lights flash up it shows run
right here
[Music]
okay we're going to take the original
key in the vehicle start the vehicle
here's my original working key with the
tile key finder you can pick one of
those up as well
pairs to your smartphone so you never
lose your keys
let's start the engine
push the brake engine started
okay
put next
checking the vehicle status
communication going on here
now this device pairs with the VIN for
your vehicle so you can use it to make
multiple keys but you can't use it on
additional vehicles
turn off the ignition
okay ignition's turned off
turn on the ignition without depressing
the brake pedal okay
I'm gonna click it twice
everything light up
[Music]
all right give some important
information key pairing will not cause
existing keys to be erased up to eight
keys can be paired to the vehicle this
vehicle currently has two so somewhere
in the world prior car dealership or
prior owner somebody lost a key and we
only have one for the vehicle right now
so we're going to program one key by the
time we're done that should go from two
to three keys
there's a new one we're going to pair
okay I turn the ignition off
all right turn on the hazards okay
hazards are flashing communicating
it's going to take up to 10 minutes here
now I will say if it's a hot day you can
roll down your windows before you start
this process you don't want to be
getting in and out of the vehicle while
the programming's going on
while we wait a quick reminder keep
watching to see the magic of our key by
photo service
okay we're almost done there we go we've
reached 100 okay remove all smart
devices and paired keys from the vehicle
place the first key to be paired close
to the center console all right so I've
got to go get this key away from the
vehicle
okay notice it tells me where to set
this key
let's set the key right here that's
important because there's a sensor in
there that will sense this new key
okay communicating countdown
first key repeatedly press and release
unlock on the key within 30 seconds keep
the key on the center console
[Music]
okay key pairing complete I just heard
the doors locked
all right that wasn't too bad was it
okay
that should be it let's test this thing
out
I'm gonna unplug programmer
turn off my flashers
we've got this is the only key in the
vehicle the other one's far enough away
where it can't be sensed
look at that can you believe how easy
that was
why the dealership wants 400 for that I
don't know
okay let's make sure this original one
still starts the engine
great
okay let's make sure the buttons work
here's the existing one
lock unlock works and here's our new one

Category: Key Programming Tutorial

Transcript:
what's up everyone welcome to the video
today we're going to take a look at how
to replace the battery in this Jeep
remote key fob
this cheap key fob is going to use
replacement battery
CR2032 and I'll put a link in the
description box of this video to where
you can purchase these batteries if
you're in need
the other thing I'm going to be using to
do this is a flathead screwdriver
the first thing I'm going to do is
remove the emergency key that's in the
bottom of the key fob
that's done by pressing this release on
the back of the key fob
hold that release down
and then the emergency key will slide
out like that
we can just set that to the side
now if we grab our screwdriver and we
hold the key fob with the buttons facing
down and then we take a look at the
bottom of it
this is the slot that that emergency key
slid out of just below that we see this
Notch right here
what I'm going to do is put my
screwdriver in that Notch push it in as
far as it will go and then I'm going to
twist the screwdriver like I'm opening a
lock with a key
and as I do that it splits the two
halves of the shell apart like that
go ahead and pull them the rest of the
way apart
and in the back half of the shell we see
our battery right here
then I'm going to grab my screwdriver
again and in this plastic holder there's
a little cutout you can see right there
that'll allow you to get under the edge
of the battery
and get it out of that holder
then I'm going to grab the new battery
and we want to make sure that we're
installing that with the plus side down
like that
and you can see in this holder there's
this little metal piece right here
that's the edge we're going to tuck in
first like that so tuck that edge in
first
and then snap it the rest of the way
down
and then we can put the two halves of
the shell back together
make sure it's all the way back together
Slide the emergency key back in
and that's it
if you could take a second to like And
subscribe it helps us out and I'd
appreciate it
thank you

we're going to connect it in a
second after it's been connected I'm
going to hit uh automatic selection the
ignition doesn't work so it's not going
to read the VIN number unless I put it
next to the ignition and now I can read
the VIN number her key the proximity

[Music]
and here we have six digigit pin code
we're going to hit okay and we're going
to go escape from this
menu and we're going to go to the
keyless
system and we're going to go to remote
control
learning we're going to open the
door I'm going to go to Smart Key
learning it tells me that uh that's
going to anyways deleted so we'll have
to write both of them together tells me
to turn ignition off and open and close
the driver door we're going to hit okay

reason for the Emergency blade is only
for the door in case the car batter is
died you can open the car manually with
the with the door I'm going to go to the

decoding again because it wasn't sitting
on the right direction as you can see
I'm adjus in my uh my belt over
[Music]
there the two um the two sides of the
key have different cuts so is going to
read like each side
differently and um and then we can cut
the
key what I want to make sure that after
that I uh decoded I want to make sure
that all the numbers on this screen are
blue if they are red that means they are
not good over here I can see that some
of them are not good so I'm going to
round it up so now everything is round

Category: Key Programming Tutorial

Transcript:
what's going on everybody today I'm
going to show you how to program a smart
key without needing a PIN code for this
2020 Toyota Corolla we've got our
working key right here
and then key that needs to be programmed
we're using the autel im508 we're going
to start out by going to the immobilizer
menu
where we will select our vehicle
go to Toyota
go ahead and
turn on the ignition
[Music]
get automatic selection
see what that comes up with
all right so there's our Vin hit okay
2020 Corolla
all right guys so you're going to want
to make sure that you got
good battery
level top right corner but this is what
we're going to do we're going to go do
control unit keyless system
first step is going to be to back up
immobilizer data via OBD
so turn off ignition
turn on hazards
all right so
[Music]
we'll hit okay
I'm gonna back up the
prom data
you notice it says that this allows us
to do immobilizer functions without pin
I'm going to show you how that's done
this might take a moment
now I mentioned that about the battery
level because I've done this before on
some Toyotas with
usually less than 11 volts or they're
pretty low and it'll start throwing
codes make the computer freak out if you
clear the codes everything's good to go
but just be mindful of that
okay so where's our eprom file
going to go to
20
there hit save
so now we got the immobilizer data
backed up we're going to back out and go
to add smart key
[Music]
only four keys can be learned
turn on the ignition
[Music]
is on
I'm going to go ahead and hit OK
[Music]
ignition off
turn on hazards
[Music]
so it says number of Keys has reach the
max let's see how many are in here four
so this is what we're gonna do now you
got to be very careful doing this
because you can
delete keys
and then
you can't get them back in there
so we'll go to erase keys
notice it says that the key is not close
to the start button will be cleared
cannot be learned again so here's our
learned key we do not want that deleted
turn on ignition turn on the hazard turn
off the hazards
ignition is on
guys I really want to show this step
here because you can screw this up
turn off the ignition turn on hazards
[Music]
[Music]
we have backed up the eprom data
foreign
so it's our bin 20.
now it's going to use this pin to
erase the keys take our key that we want
to be working
put it near buzzer
buzzer will beep it has beeped once
so that key is going to be learned back
into the car
any others the other three are no longer
going to work
in addition to not working
you will not be able to reprogram them
into another vehicle
so don't learn that the hard way make
sure you have them all ready to go in
your hands
so now we got one key
see if it still works
[Music]
I'm gonna close this door
stop that beeping
all right so we're still good that key
still functions that's what we want to
see let's go back to add smart key
maximum four can be learned
turn on the ignition
ignition is on
[Music]
let's get some Focus back in on that
all right okay
there's our van
please check yes that's our bin
turn ignition off
hazard lights on
okay
yes we have backed up the eprom data so
that first step I showed you in the
beginning
this is how you get by this is how you
get past the PIN code
so
be mindful you don't have to pay for PIN
codes on these
so there it is reading pin
key programmed key
close to the start button
it's this guy right here
little beep once
beep twice
so we're gonna let it time out here
should tell us to turn on the ignition
and put the key back up to the button
one more time
so let's go ahead and do that
put learn key close to start button
it's our new one
you heard that beep learning succeeded
so if everything was done correctly
let's make sure they work
turn ignition off
this is our new key
let's check our old one
and we'll fire it up see when it
when you unlock the vehicle that padlock
goes away
so we'll put our foot on the brake
make sure she fires up
[Music]
those look like some programmed keys I
hope that helps guys remember don't pay
for your PIN codes on this newer Toyota
system smart key let's back up your
mobilizer data get the PIN code that way
remember that you do have a maximum of
four keys and if you're gonna delete
Keys these cannot be reprogrammed or
refurbished so I recommend OEM new only
thank you hope this helps

the video
so what i'm gonna do right now is a
program key this is the key i'll be

with the acura logo on the back so i'll
be programming this one
to the car so it'll lock and unlock the
doors and it will start the vehicle
just like the original one okay
so right now i'm going to go to
immobilization
and this one has lifetime updates so
this will con
keep getting updates for the life that
you have it
which is amazing so i'm going to acura
then i'll go to smart key system
then this would be the three button
smart key system
okay so then they have add smart key and
all smart keys lost we're not going to
do all smart keys laws because
we don't want to erase the keys that are
already there so basically what i'm
going to do now
is click on add a smart key okay double
click on whether the ignition can be
switched on so basically what this would
do is
this would force start the car in case
you lost all your keys
for this vehicle it can force start the
car on if you hit
um no it'll force start the car on and
then the ignition will come on
just so you can be able to program the
vehicle to the ignition

click
because it can turn on which is this
you'll see this on the dash
showing that it's on okay so it says
double click on the start button
yes the ignition turns on so now it's
communicating with it
said take all smart keys out of the car
so that's what i'm going to do
i'm going to take this key and move it
far away from the car

the program smart key
give me one second okay so now i have
the program smart key
is in the car now the system is
configuring

the car and put it to the side about 12
to 15 feet away
now i'm going to bring the new one to
the car because it's going to tell me to
bring the new smart key
to the car so
let's just take those smart keys out of
the car now put the new smart key into
the car
okay put the new smart key in the car

Category: Key Programming Tutorial

Transcript:
In this video, I'll show you step by
step how to program and add a new key to
a 2012 BMW 5 series F10. I used an
aftermarket key purchased from
AliExpress for only $20. The procedure
was completed using an Autofix IM1
interface together with the XP1 Pro IMO
tool. All the tools used are linked in
the video description. I started by
connecting the Autofix interface to the
vehicle's OBD port. Then I accessed the
IMO function, selected the BMW brand,
and used the automatic selection
feature. The car was correctly
identified via the VIN and I continued
with the IMO status scan function.
[Music]
After running the IMOSA scan, I
performed the quick DTC cleaning
function.
Heat.
[Music]
Hey, heat. Hey, heat.
[Applause]
Once the process was completed, I made
sure there were no remaining errors in
any of the modules. This is a very
important step. Next, I use the key add
guided function. The procedure is well
documented and it's important to follow
all the steps in detail.
After completing step one, perform
pre-processing, you must follow the
manual instructions provided in step
two, generate a key.
[Music]
Heat.
Heat.
[Music]
Heat up here.
[Music]
Heat. Heat.
[Music]
At the end of the process, it's
essential that both step one and step
two display the final message, success.
Once that's confirmed, both keys will
function properly. If you have any
questions, feel free to leave a comment
below.

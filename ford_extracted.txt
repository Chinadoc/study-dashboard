1. FORD PATS SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The Passive Anti-Theft System (PATS) is Ford's immobilizer technology that has been standard on Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles since 1996. Understanding the different PATS generations is critical for successful key programming.
1.1 PATS Generations
PATS I (1996-1998)
Only ONE working key required for programming
Standalone PATS control module
Maximum of 16 keys can be programmed to vehicle
Simpler security protocol
PATS II (1998-2000+)
TWO working keys required for on-board programming
Anti-scan function: 30-second lockout after failed programming attempt
Most common system found in Ford vehicles
Maximum of 8 keys can be programmed
E-PATS / Enhanced PATS (2000+)
Encrypted transponder communication
Enhanced security features with rolling codes
Integrated with PCM or BCM depending on model year
1.2 PATS Control Function Types
Ford uses different PATS control function types (A through G) that determine how key data is stored and what procedures are required after module replacement:
1.3 Parameter Reset vs Key Relearn
Understanding the difference between Parameter Reset and Key Relearn is critical for PCM/BCM replacement scenarios:
Parameter Reset: Required for Type B/C/F/G when only the PCM is replaced. Requires scan tool or J2534 device with Ford Module Programming (FMP) subscription. A 10-minute security access period is required before parameter reset can be performed.
Key Relearn: Required when PCM is replaced and key data cannot be transferred from the old module. All keys must be re-programmed to the new module.

2. TRANSPONDER CHIP EVOLUTION
Ford has utilized several transponder chip technologies throughout its PATS evolution. Correct chip identification is essential for successful key programming.
2.1 Chip Type Reference Chart
2.2 Chip Designation Notes
ID 4D63 chips are available in both 40-bit and 80-bit versions. The 80-bit version can be "downgraded" to work with 40-bit systems but not vice versa.
ID 83 is essentially a variant designation for the 80-bit 4D63 chip used in specific Ford models - some programming tools label these differently.
HITAG Pro (ID49) uses NXP NCF2951F or PCF7939FA/PCF7953P chips with 128-bit AES encryption.
When ordering keys, always verify both the chip type AND frequency to ensure compatibility.

4. ON-BOARD PROGRAMMING PROCEDURES
On-board programming (OBP) allows key programming without specialized equipment when the customer has two working keys. These procedures vary by vehicle type.
4.1 Two-Key Learning Procedure (PATS II - Keyed Ignition)
Standard procedure for vehicles with keyed ignition and PATS II system. Requires TWO previously programmed keys.
Insert first programmed PATS key into ignition
Turn ignition to RUN position (not START)
Wait for security/theft indicator light to go out (approximately 3-5 seconds)
Turn ignition to OFF position and remove key
Within 10 seconds, insert second programmed PATS key
Turn ignition to RUN position
Wait for security indicator to go out
Turn ignition to OFF and remove key
Within 10 seconds, insert NEW unprogrammed key
Turn ignition to RUN position
Wait for security indicator to go out (confirms programming)
Turn OFF and wait 30 seconds before testing
Repeat steps 9-12 for additional keys
4.2 Push-Button Start Smart Key Programming
For vehicles with push-button start and intelligent access system. Requires TWO previously programmed smart keys.
Place first programmed smart key in backup slot (center console, cupholder, or glove box)
Press START/STOP button without pressing brake (accessory mode)
Wait 5 seconds
Press START/STOP button again
Remove first key from backup slot
Wait 5 seconds, then place second programmed key in backup slot
Press START/STOP button
Wait 5 seconds, press START/STOP button again
Remove second key from backup slot
Wait 5 seconds, place NEW unprogrammed key in backup slot
Press START/STOP button and HOLD until door locks cycle
Door lock cycle confirms successful programming
Test all remotes for proper operation
4.3 Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) Programming
For programming the remote portion of keys (lock/unlock buttons). This is separate from transponder programming.
Close all doors, then open driver's door
Press unlock button on driver's door panel
Insert key in ignition
Turn ignition from OFF to RUN 8 times within 10 seconds, ending in RUN
Door locks will cycle to confirm programming mode
Within 20 seconds, press any button on first remote
Door locks will cycle to confirm remote accepted
Repeat for additional remotes (up to 8 total)
Turn ignition to OFF to exit programming mode
4.4 Backup Slot Locations by Model

5. AUTEL IM608 PROGRAMMING PROCEDURES
5.1 Standard Menu Navigation
IMMO → Ford → Manual Selection → Ford → USA → [Model] → [Year Range] → Smart Key/Transponder Key → Control Unit → Key Learning
5.2 Add Key Procedure (With Working Keys)
Requires 2 working keys for most PATS II systems
Place keys in backup slot when prompted
Follow on-screen prompts for key insertion sequence
System may prompt for ignition cycles
5.3 All Keys Lost (AKL) Procedure
Menu Path: Key Learning → All Smart Keys Lost
Network connection required (pay-per-use function for some models)
Must program minimum 2 keys to complete AKL
System will delete all previously learned keys
5.4 2021+ Ford RH850 BCM Procedure
For 2021+ F-150, Bronco, Mustang Mach-E, and similar vehicles with RH850 processor BCM:
Locate BCM - passenger side footwell, under instrument panel
Remove BCM from vehicle
Connect BCM to XP400 Pro with APB131 adapter
Navigate: Ford → F-150 → 2021-2023 → Smart Key → Control Unit → Keyless System (CAN) → Key Learning → Read Dflash Data
Read and save BCM D-flash data
Reinstall BCM in vehicle
Program keys via OBD with loaded D-flash data
5.5 NASTF/VSP Requirement Notice
⚠️ CRITICAL: As of recent updates, Autel IM508/IM608 may require NASTF (National Automotive Service Task Force) login for 2015+ Ford key programming. Some functions may be restricted without VSP (Vehicle Security Professional) credentials. Verify current tool capabilities before purchase.
5.6 XP400 Pro Requirements
Key generation for HITAG Pro ID49 chips
D-flash reading for 2021+ models (requires APB131 adapter)
EEPROM backup/restore functions
Bench programming when OBD fails

6. ALL KEYS LOST (AKL) PROCEDURES
All Keys Lost scenarios require specialized equipment and procedures. The approach varies significantly by model year and PATS generation.
6.1 Pre-2015 Vehicles
Older PATS systems may allow incode/outcode calculation
Some require 10-minute security timer
Programming via scan tool with appropriate security access
6.2 2015-2020 Vehicles
Requires scan tool with Ford AKL capability
Network connection typically required for server authentication
Pay-per-use tokens may be required
NASTF VSP credentials may be necessary
6.3 2021+ Vehicles (RH850 BCM)
Newest Ford vehicles use RH850 processor-based BCM requiring bench work:
BCM must be physically removed for D-flash extraction
Requires XP400 Pro with APB131 adapter (Autel) or equivalent
Alternative tools: OBDSTAR G3 with RH850 adapter, Abrites with ZN085
Some BCM versions (MU5T) may only be programmable via Ford FDRS
Supported BCM: R7F701573 version
6.4 Ford FDRS/IDS Alternative
For vehicles not supported by aftermarket tools, Ford's dealer-level diagnostic system remains an option:
Requires J2534 passthru device (VCI200, VXDIAG, etc.)
Ford subscription required
Most reliable method for newest vehicles
Supports all PATS functions including parameter reset

⚠️ CRITICAL: Keys may appear physically identical but operate on different frequencies. ALWAYS verify FCC ID before ordering!
8.2 Theft Indicator Light Diagnostics
8.3 Common Pitfalls
40-bit vs 80-bit chips: Ensure correct chip bit rate. 80-bit keys will NOT work in 40-bit systems.
ID63 vs ID83 labeling: Same chip, different tool designations. Verify compatibility.
2024 F-150: Cannot self-program. Requires professional locksmith/dealer tools.
Explorer 2024: Frequency changed to 434 MHz from previous 315/902 MHz.
Aftermarket keys: Some aftermarket keys ship with incorrect chips. Verify before programming.

    "Ford F-150 (2015-2020)": {
        "overview": "The Ford F-150 (2015-2020) utilizes a proximity-based smart key system (8A chip). Programming can be completed via OBD-II using tools like Autel IM508/IM608 or AutoProPAD.",
        "preparation": "1. **Tools Required**: Autel IM508/IM608 with XP400 (if CAS/EWS), or AutoProPAD.\n2. **Programming Slot**: The programming slot is located at the bottom of the center console cup holder. Remove the rubber cover to reveal the slot.\n3. **Vehicle Prep**: Ensure the vehicle battery is stable (use a maintainer if possible). Turn off all accessories (lights, AC).",
        "procedure": "### Add Smart Key (with 1 working key)\n1. Connect the programmer to the OBD-II port.\n2. Navigate to: **Ford -> Manual Selection -> F-150 -> 2015-2020 -> Smart Key**.\n3. Select **Hot Function -> Add Smart Key**.\n4. Place the working key in the center console slot.\n5. Follow the on-screen prompts; the programmer will read the IMMO data.\n6. When prompted, remove the working key and insert the **NEW** smart key into the slot.\n7. The programmer will signal 'Learning Success' once complete.\n\n### All Keys Lost (AKL)\n1. Connect to OBD-II and select **All Keys Lost**.\n2. The system will perform a 10-minute security bypass (Flash/Wait).\n3. Follow the instructions to place the NO. 1 key in the slot, then the NO. 2 key.",
        "notes": "💡 **Tip**: If the ignition won't turn on, ensure the key is placed correctly in the cup holder slot.\n⚠️ **Warning**: Always verify the part number (e.g., HC3Z-15K601-AG) matches the vehicle's frequency (902MHz or 315MHz)."

    "BMW 3 Series (2005-2013)": {
        "overview": "The E90/E60 series uses the CAS3 or CAS3+ immobilizer system. Programming requires a specialized tool like Autel XP400 or Xhorse Key Tool Plus to read the EEPROM and generate a key.",
        "preparation": "1. **Tools Required**: Autel IM508/IM608 + XP400 Programmer.\n2. **Stable Voltage**: BMW systems are sensitive to voltage drops during programming. Connect a high-quality battery stabilizer (70A+).\n3. **Internet Connection**: Required for server-side calculation of CAS3+ ISN.",
        "procedure": "1. Connect IM608/IM508 to OBD-II and plug in the XP400 programmer.\n2. Select **BMW -> Automatic Selection -> IMMO Status Scan**.\n3. Perform a **Quick DTC Cleaning** to clear any background errors.\n4. Select **Add Key (Guided)**.\n5. Insert the existing working key into the ignition to read the CAS data.\n6. When prompted, remove the working key and insert it into the **XP400 Programmer** slot to read the key ID.\n7. Insert the **NEW** blank key into the XP400 slot to write the new data.\n8. Finally, insert the new key into the vehicle's ignition slot to finish synchronization.",
        "notes": "💡 **Tip**: If the car has 'Comfort Access', make sure the new key supports it. Non-CA keys will only work when inserted into the slot.\n⚠️ **Warning**: Never disconnect the battery or programmer while the CAS unit is being 'pre-processed'."

    "Chevrolet Silverado (2014-2018)": {
        "overview": "The 2014-2018 Silverado (and GMC Sierra) uses a keyed ignition or proximity system with a 46 chip. Modern tools can program these via OBD in under 5 minutes.",
        "preparation": "1. **Tools Required**: Autel IM608, AutoProPAD, or Advanced Diagnostics MVP Pro.\n2. **Part Verification**: Most models use the M3N-32337141 FCC ID (315MHz).",
        "procedure": "1. Connect the tool to the OBD-II port.\n2. Select **GM -> Chevrolet -> Silverado -> 2014-2018**.\n3. Select **Remote Learning** or **Immobilizer & Keys**.\n4. **Add Key**: Insert the existing key and turn to 'On' (Engine Off).\n5. The programmer will prompt to insert the NEW key. Follow the on-screen timer (usually 1 minute).\n6. **Remote Pairing**: Press and hold the **LOCK** and **UNLOCK** buttons simultaneously on the new remote until you hear a chime from the dashboard.\n7. Test the remote start and lock/unlock functions.",
        "notes": "💡 **Tip**: Up to 8 keys/remotes can be programmed to one vehicle.\n⚠️ **Warning**: If the vehicle has 'RPO ATH' (Passive Entry), the programming procedure requires a different backend access method."

    "Dodge Ram 1500 (2019-2024)": {
        "overview": "Current generation Ram trucks (DT) feature a Security Gateway Module (SGW). Programming requires a bypass cable to communicate with the vehicle.",
        "preparation": "1. **Tools Required**: Autel IM608 + **SGW Bypass Cable** (12+8 adapter).\n2. **Access**: The SGW module is typically located behind the radio/multimedia screen. You must plug the 12+8 adapter directly into the SGW connectors.\n3. **Key Type**: 4A Chip, Smart Proximity Key.",
        "procedure": "1. Install the 12+8 Bypass Cable behind the radio.\n2. Connect the programmer to the bypass cable and OBD-II.\n3. Select **Dodge -> Manual Selection -> Ram -> 2019-2024**.\n4. Select **IMMO Status Scan -> Add Key**.\n5. Follow prompts to turn the ignition OFF and turn on Hazard lights.\n6. Hold the **NEW** smart key against the Start/Stop button when prompted.\n7. You will hear the locks cycle and 'Programming Success' will appear.",
        "notes": "🚨 **Important**: A 12+8 SGW bypass cable is **MANDATORY**. Programming will fail if using only the standard OBD-II port.\n💡 **Tip**: Ensure you have a stable Wi-Fi connection to pull the PIN code from the Stellantis servers."

                        <li>First, Backup Immobilizer Data. Navigate: Toyota -&gt; Control Unit -&gt;
Keyless System -&gt; Backup immobilizer data via OBD. Turn ignition OFF
and hazards ON. This saves an EEPROM file and allows function without a</li>
                        <li>If the system is full (max keys reached), you must Erase Keys.
* Navigate to Erase Keys. The tool will use the saved EEPROM file.
* Hold the key you wish to KEEP near the start button until it beeps
once. This key will be retained; all others will be erased.</li>
                        <li>To add a new key, navigate to Add Smart Key.</li>
                        <li>Turn ignition ON. The tool will use the backed-up data to bypass the
PIN.</li>
                        <li>Hold the working key near the start button (beeps once), then hold the
new key near the start button (beeps twice).</li>
                        <li>Follow final prompts to hold the new key to the button again to finalize.
"Learning succeeded" will be displayed.</li>
                        <li>* This procedure is identical to the Toyota Camry (2018-2024)
process.
* Part 1: Program Key Chip. Set programmer to KEY, ignition ON
with working key, plug in programmer, wait for solid red
security light, swap to new key, wait 60 seconds for light to go

keys, be extremely careful to keep the one you want to save; erased keys
cannot be re-learned.</p>

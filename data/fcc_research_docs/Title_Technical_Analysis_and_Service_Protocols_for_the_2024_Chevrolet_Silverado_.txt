Title: Technical Analysis and Service Protocols for the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado Smart Key Ecosystem
1. Executive Summary
The 2024 Chevrolet Silverado represents a mature deployment of General Motors' "Global B" electrical architecture, also known internally as the Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP). This architecture marks a definitive departure from the legacy Global A systems, introducing significant complexities in vehicle security, access control, and diagnostic communication. For automotive security professionals, locksmiths, and fleet technicians, the 2024 model year mandates a complete retooling of hardware and procedural knowledge. The system is characterized by the migration to encrypted CAN FD (Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate) protocols, the elimination of mechanical ignition cylinders in favor of full push-to-start implementations across light-duty trims, and a reliance on server-side authentication for all key learning events.
This report provides an exhaustive technical dissection of the 2024 Silverado’s Smart Key system. It examines the hardware layer, identifying the specific NXP HITAG-PRO transponder technologies and 433 MHz radio frequency protocols that define the transmitter's operation. It analyzes the mechanical redundancy provided by the HU100 "V-Series" high-security keyway, addressing common industry confusion regarding code series and cutting depths. Furthermore, it details the strict button-to-trim mapping logic enforced by the Body Control Module (BCM), which dictates the functionality of remote start and power tailgate features.
Crucially, this analysis addresses the programming dichotomy facing the service industry: the OEM path utilizing Techline Connect (SPS2) versus the aftermarket path leveraging proprietary server calculations from vendors like Autel and Xhorse. The report elucidates the critical role of the CAN FD adapter in bridging legacy diagnostic tools with the Silverado’s high-speed bus, and provides a granular troubleshooting framework for resolving communication failures, interference issues, and "locked" component states.


 Image 2. Architectural Context: The Global B (VIP) Paradigm
To fully comprehend the operational constraints of the 2024 Silverado's smart key, one must first deconstruct the environment in which it operates. The Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP), colloquially referred to as "Global B," is not merely an incremental update to the previous Global A architecture; it is a fundamental redesign of the vehicle's central nervous system. This architecture was developed to support the massive data throughput required by advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), such as Super Cruise, and to facilitate secure Over-the-Air (OTA) updates.
2.1. The Shift from Global A to Global B
For nearly a decade, General Motors vehicles relied on the Global A architecture. In that ecosystem, the Body Control Module (BCM) acted as the primary gatekeeper for access control, communicating over standard high-speed and low-speed GMLAN networks. Security was present but relatively static; if a technician could gain access to the BCM's EEPROM or bypass the initial handshake, key programming could often be performed offline or with simple challenge-response calculators.
The 2024 Silverado, however, operates within the Global B framework. In this paradigm, the BCM is no longer a standalone authority. Instead, it functions as part of a distributed trust network involving the Radio Frequency (RF) Hub, the Engine Control Module (ECM), and the Gateway Module (SGM/CGM). Accessing the programming functions of the BCM requires navigating through a dedicated Serial Data Gateway Module. This gateway acts as a firewall, separating the external OBD-II port from the internal vehicle networks. Unlike the direct access available in Global A systems, where a diagnostic tool could speak directly to the BCM, the Global B architecture requires that all diagnostic requests pass through this gateway. The gateway inspects the traffic and requires a cryptographic certificate—authenticated via a backend server—before allowing any "secured" operations, such as adding a key or recalibrating an immobilizer.
2.2. The CAN FD Communication Backbone
The physical layer of this communication network is CAN FD (Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate). This protocol is the single most critical technical differentiator for the 2024 model year and is the primary reason for the obsolescence of older locksmith tooling.
Standard CAN (ISO 11898-2), used in previous generations, is limited to a data rate of 500 kbps (kilobits per second) and a payload size of 8 bytes per frame. While sufficient for basic engine telemetry, this bandwidth is inadequate for the complex cryptographic exchanges and massive firmware payloads of modern VIP vehicles. CAN FD expands this capability significantly. It allows the data phase of the communication frame to switch to a higher frequency—up to 5 Mbps (megabits per second) or more—and increases the payload capacity to 64 bytes.
The implications for key programming are profound. The 2024 Silverado's immobilizer system utilizes these larger data frames to transmit longer, more robust encryption keys during the handshake process. A legacy OBD-II tool equipped only with standard CAN transceivers simply cannot interpret these signals. It will see the high-speed data phase as line noise or errors, resulting in a total failure to communicate. Therefore, any interface used on the 2024 Silverado—whether it is a J2534 Pass-Thru device for OEM software or a handheld tablet for aftermarket programming—must possess a hardware-level CAN FD transceiver.
2.3. Cybersecurity and the Trusted Execution Environment
Global B implements a robust cybersecurity strategy that extends beyond simple encryption. The architecture relies on a "Trusted Execution Environment" within the modules. When a key programming session is initiated, the vehicle does not simply accept a new key ID. It initiates a seed-key exchange with the GM backend server (via the internet-connected diagnostic tool).
This server-side check validates the tool's credentials and the vehicle's status. If the vehicle has been reported stolen or if the tool is using a blacklisted IP address, the server will refuse to issue the response code required to unlock the BCM. Furthermore, the system enforces a strict time delay, typically 10 to 12 minutes, during the programming sequence. This delay is managed by the vehicle's firmware and cannot be bypassed by the server. It serves as a physical deterrent to "smash-and-grab" attacks, ensuring that a thief cannot simply plug in a tool and drive away in seconds. This architecture necessitates that the technician maintains a stable internet connection and a clean power supply for the duration of the process, as a drop in voltage or connectivity during this secure wait period can abort the transaction and potentially leave the module in an indeterminate state.
3. Transmitter Hardware: The Smart Key Fob
The user's primary interface with the 2024 Silverado's security system is the "Smart Key," a proximity-based transmitter that supports Passive Entry and Passive Start (PEPS). While aesthetically similar to fobs used in the 2019-2022 models, the internal architecture of the 2024 fob is specific to the Global B platform.
3.1. Radio Frequency and Regulatory Identification
The 2024 Silverado smart key operates on a frequency of 433.92 MHz (commonly denoted as 433 MHz or 434 MHz). This represents a permanent shift away from the 315 MHz frequency that dominated the North American domestic truck market for decades. The move to 433 MHz aligns General Motors' global platforms, allowing the same RF receivers to be used in markets across Europe and Asia, thereby reducing supply chain complexity.
The definitive regulatory identifier for the 2024 model year is the FCC ID: YG0G21TB2. This identifier is ubiquitous across all trim levels of the Silverado 1500 and the heavy-duty 2500HD/3500HD lineup. Technicians must be vigilant when sourcing parts, as typographical errors in aftermarket listings often confuse the zero ('0') with the letter 'O', resulting in listings like "YGOG21TB2". The correct regulatory ID is strictly YG0G21TB2. Additionally, the Industry Canada (IC) certification number is 7812A-A3C054339, providing a secondary method of verification for parts sourced from Canadian suppliers.
3.2. Transponder Technology: NXP HITAG-PRO
Embedded within the key's printed circuit board (PCB) is the transponder chipset, which handles the secure authentication with the immobilizer. The 2024 Silverado utilizes the NXP HITAG-PRO family of transponders, identified in most locksmith programming tools as ID49.
The ID49 chip utilizes AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) 128-bit encryption for its challenge-response mechanism. Unlike older "rolling code" systems (such as Hitag 2) which could be vulnerable to replay attacks or cryptographic analysis, the Hitag Pro system employs a mutual authentication protocol. The vehicle sends a random challenge to the key; the key encrypts this challenge using its secret key and sends the response back. Simultaneously, the key challenges the vehicle. This bidirectional verification ensures that the device is not being spoofed.
A critical characteristic of the Global B implementation of the ID49 chip is its immutability. During the initial programming process, the vehicle's BCM writes a configuration file to the key's Protected Memory sector. Once this sector is written, the "Protection Byte" is set, and the key becomes "locked" to that specific VIN. It is physically impossible to reprogram a used 2024 Silverado key to a different vehicle using standard diagnostic tools. The key effectively becomes a "one-time write" device in the field. To reuse a key, it must be "unlocked" or "virginized" using specialized EEPROM programmers capable of wiping the NXP chip's memory back to its factory default state. Consequently, technicians purchasing "refurbished" keys must verify that the seller has performed this unlocking service; otherwise, the programming procedure will fail at the final synchronization step.
3.3. Battery Architecture and Power Management
The power source for the 2024 smart key is a single CR2450 lithium coin cell battery. This choice is significant. The CR2450 offers a capacity of approximately 600-620 mAh, nearly triple the capacity of the pervasive CR2032 (approx. 220 mAh) used in older remotes.
The necessity for this increased energy density stems from the aggressive "polling" behavior of the Global B Passive Entry system. To support features like "Approach Detection" (where the vehicle lights up as the user walks towards it) and secure walk-away locking, the key fob is in near-constant communication with the vehicle's LF (Low Frequency) antennas. The fob wakes up frequently to check for proximity signals, consuming significantly more power than a traditional remote entry system. The larger CR2450 ensures that the user does not experience premature battery failure despite this increased duty cycle.
4. Part Number Ecosystem and Trim Logic
While all 2024 Silverado smart keys share the same FCC ID (YG0G21TB2) and chip type (ID49), they are differentiated by their button configurations and the specific features enabled on their printed circuit boards. The Body Control Module (BCM) is programmed to expect a specific button map based on the vehicle's trim level and Option Codes (RPO). Using a mismatching key can lead to loss of functionality, such as the inability to lower the tailgate remotely.
4.1. The 3-Button Configuration (Work Truck)
The entry-level configuration is the 3-button fob, designated primarily for the Work Truck (WT) and certain fleet fleet trims. This remote features buttons for Lock, Unlock, and Panic. It conspicuously lacks a Remote Start button and a Tailgate release button. The OEM part number for this variant is 13548436.
It is important to note that even the base Work Truck in the 2024 model year utilizes this Push-to-Start technology. The era of the bladed ignition key for the light-duty Silverado 1500 is effectively over. While some base model 2500HD/3500HD trucks in specific fleet configurations might still be ordered with a keyed ignition, the vast majority of the 2024 production run utilizes the smart key platform.
4.2. The 4-Button Configuration (Custom / LT)
Moving up the trim ladder to the Custom, Custom Trail Boss, and standard LT trims, the vehicle is equipped with the 4-button remote. This variant adds the Remote Vehicle Start (RVS) button. Remote start is a standard feature on these trims, driven by the RPO code BTV. The primary OEM part number for this fob is 13548442. This remote is also associated with the GM Accessory Remote Start Kit (Part # 85768274), which allows owners of lower trims to upgrade their vehicle's software to enable remote start.
4.3. The 5-Button Configuration (LTZ / High Country / ZR2)
The most complex variant is the 5-button fob, used on the high-feature trims: LTZ, High Country, ZR2, and RST models equipped with the relevant convenience packages. This remote includes buttons for Lock, Unlock, Remote Start, Panic, and the Power Tailgate release.
The power tailgate function (RPO code QT5 or similar) requires hardware actuators in the tailgate itself. The primary OEM part number is 13548437. However, research indicates a cluster of interchangeable part numbers for this high-spec remote, including 13514331, 13560205, 13548440, and 13560219. These supersessions often reflect minor supply chain adjustments or internal board revisions by the supplier (Hella or Continental) that do not impact the user experience or programming compatibility.
4.4. The Silverado EV Variation
The 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV introduces a unique variation. While it physically resembles the ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) key and shares the YG0G21TB2 FCC ID, its internal logic is mapped differently to account for the electric architecture. Specifically, the 5th button, which controls the tailgate on the gas truck, may be mapped to control the "Frunk" (Front Trunk) or "eTrunk" on the EV. The specific part number for the Silverado EV is 13547258. Technicians are advised to strictly use this EV-specific part number when servicing the electric model to ensure the correct signal is sent to the BCM for the hood/trunk actuators.


 Image 5. Mechanical Security Interface: The HU100 System
Despite the digitization of the ignition process, the 2024 Silverado retains a mechanical redundancy for emergency access. If the vehicle battery fails or the key fob battery is depleted, the driver must physically unlock the door to gain entry. This functionality is provided by the HU100 high-security lock system.
5.1. Keyway Geometry and Security
The HU100 is a "laser cut" or sidewinder keyway, technically classified as an internal 2-track system. The key blade is rectangular, with a milled groove running down the center of each face. The variable depth of this groove interacts with the split tumblers inside the lock cylinder. Unlike the edge-cut keys of the pre-2014 era, the HU100 offers significantly higher resistance to lock picking and manipulation, requiring specialized Lishi tools or precise milling machines to originate.
5.2. The "V-Series" vs. "Z-Series" Controversy
A significant point of confusion in the aftermarket service industry involves the "Code Series" utilized for the 2024 model. Historically, General Motors utilized an 8-cut version of the HU100 system, often associated with the "Z-Series" codes (Z0001-Z6314). However, with the introduction of the T1 truck platform (2019+) and continuing into the 2024 model year, the Silverado utilizes the 10-Cut System, designated as the "V-Series" (V0001-V5573).
The confusion arises because many aftermarket databases have not been updated to reflect this shift for the newest model years, occasionally listing "Z-Series" keys for 2019+ trucks. This is incorrect. The 2024 Silverado door lock cylinder contains wafers that correspond to the 10-cut geometry. Attempting to cut a key using the 8-cut spacing and depth charts will result in a non-functional key that will not turn the lock.
5.3. Decoding and Origination Strategy
For a locksmith tasked with generating a key when all are lost, the 2024 Silverado presents a simplified landscape compared to its predecessors, primarily due to the absence of an ignition cylinder.
* The Door Lock Architecture: The driver's door lock cylinder typically contains wafers in positions 5 through 10 (and occasionally 3 through 10 depending on the specific assembly batch).
* The Ignition Constraints (Legacy): In previous models with a keyed ignition, the ignition cylinder contained cuts 1 through 7. This created a "blind spot" where decoding the door (5-10) left the locksmith guessing cuts 1-4 to make the ignition turn.
* The 2024 Reality: Since the 2024 Silverado is exclusively push-to-start, there is no mechanical ignition cylinder to turn. The mechanical key's only function is to operate the door lock. Therefore, the technician only needs to decode the wafers present in the door lock (positions 5-10) and cut the key accordingly. The depths for positions 1-4 are technically irrelevant to the operation of the vehicle, although most key cutting machines will require some value to be entered to complete the cutting cycle. A default cut of "1" or "2" is usually sufficient for these unused positions.
The preferred tool for decoding this lock is the Lishi HU100 (10-Cut) V.3. It is critical to select the "10-Cut" version of the tool. The "8-Cut" tool has different spacing guides and will lead to misread depths. The depths are read on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is the shallowest cut (closest to the key surface) and 4 is the deepest cut.
5.4. Known Mechanical Issues
Recent field reports indicate a specific wear issue with the HU100 cylinders in late-model GM trucks. Even when a key is cut to the correct factory code, the wafers inside the cylinder may not retract fully flush with the shear line. This is due to tight manufacturing tolerances and the accumulation of grime or oxidation. In such cases, the key may turn the lock with resistance or not at all. Technicians have reported that cutting the key slightly "deeper" (e.g., adding +0.1mm to the depth setting on the milling machine) or physically filing the key tips can compensate for this lack of clearance. Alternatively, in "All Keys Lost" scenarios, replacing the door lock cylinder with a pre-coded unit is often a more reliable, albeit more expensive, solution than attempting to wear-in a freshly cut key.
6. Programming Procedures: The Digital Handshake
Programming a key to the 2024 Silverado is the most technically demanding aspect of the service, governed strictly by the Global B security protocols. There are two primary pathways: the OEM method using GM's proprietary software, and the aftermarket method using advanced diagnostic tablets. Both methods require strict adherence to prerequisites regarding voltage and connectivity.
6.1. The Emergency Programming Pocket
Regardless of the software used, the physical interface for the programming event is the vehicle's Low Frequency (LF) antenna pocket. This pocket allows the vehicle to communicate with the key transponder inductively, even if the key's battery is dead.
* Bucket Seat Configuration: In trucks equipped with a full center console (bucket seats), the programming pocket is located inside the center console storage bin. It is typically a defined slot at the bottom of the bin or, in some layouts, located in the cupholder area.
* Bench Seat Configuration: For trucks with the 40/20/40 split bench seat, the location is more obscure. The technician must lift the bottom cushion of the center jump seat to reveal the under-seat storage compartment. The programming slot is located inside this compartment, often towards the rear.
Correct placement is non-negotiable. If the key is not sitting flat in the precise center of the antenna field, the BCM will fail to detect the transponder during the "Ready for Remote" phase.
6.2. Method A: The OEM Path (SPS2)
The official method utilized by dealerships is the Service Programming System 2 (SPS2), accessed via the Techline Connect platform.
* Hardware Requirements: A J2534 Pass-Thru interface is required. While the GM MDI2 is the standard, high-quality aftermarket J2534 tools (such as the DrewlinQ or Autel MaxiFlash) are compatible provided they support CAN FD. Using a J2534 tool without CAN FD support will result in a failure to communicate with the vehicle.
* Software and Subscription: Access requires a "Vehicle Programming" subscription purchased from acdelcotds.com. The cost is typically $45 USD per VIN for a 24-month access period.
* Procedure:
   1. Launch Techline Connect: Connect the laptop to the vehicle via the J2534 tool. Ensure the laptop has a stable high-speed internet connection.
   2. Select Controller: Navigate to the "Immobilizer Learning" menu.
   3. Authentication: The software will contact the GM backend server. The server verifies the VIN and the tool's credentials.
   4. The Security Wait: Once authenticated, the system initiates a 10 to 12-minute security timer. This is a mandatory wait. The technician must ensure the laptop does not sleep and the vehicle battery voltage remains above 12.5V.
   5. Key Learning: Upon completion of the timer, the software will prompt to place the first key in the pocket. The dashboard cluster will display "Ready for Remote #1".
   6. Cycle Ignition: The technician presses the Start button (holding for roughly 12 seconds in some sequences) until the cluster confirms the key is learned.
   7. Finalize: The procedure is repeated for subsequent keys.
6.3. Method B: The Aftermarket Path (Autel / Xhorse)
For locksmiths and independent shops, aftermarket tools like the Autel MaxiIM series offer a more integrated solution that does not always require a laptop or per-VIN credit purchase (though some functions may use "tokens").
* Tool Compatibility: The Autel MaxiIM IM608 Pro II and IM508S are the current industry standards. Both come with the V200 VCI, which has built-in CAN FD support.
* Legacy Tool Warning: Technicians using the older IM608 or IM508 (non-S) must use a separate Autel CAN FD Adapter connected between the VCI and the OBD port. Without this physical adapter, the legacy VCI cannot interpret the high-speed data frames of the 2024 Silverado.
* Server Calculation: Unlike older GM systems where the PIN code could be read locally from the BCM, the 2024 Silverado requires a server-side calculation to determine the security access code. When the technician selects "Add Key" or "Immo Status Scan," the tablet uploads encrypted BCM data to the Autel server. The server computes the PIN and sends it back to the tool. This process requires a strong Wi-Fi connection.
* Procedure:
   1. Vehicle Selection: GM > Chevrolet > Silverado > 2022-2024 > Smart Key.
   2. Immo Status Scan: This performs a health check of all immobilizer-related modules (BCM, ECM, RF Hub).
   3. Add Key: Follow the on-screen prompts. The tool will initiate the 12-minute security bypass.
   4. Key Provisioning: Place the virgin key in the pocket when prompted. The tool commands the BCM to write the configuration to the key.
   5. Verification: Test remote functions (Lock/Unlock) and start the engine.
6.4. The "All Keys Lost" (AKL) Scenario
The "All Keys Lost" scenario on a 2024 Silverado is significantly higher risk than a simple "Add Key."
* Data Erasure: The AKL procedure will erase all existing keys from the BCM memory. If the procedure fails midway (e.g., due to internet loss or battery death), the vehicle is left with zero keys and a potentially corrupted BCM state.
* Power Supply Criticality: Because the BCM is the only source of truth in an AKL situation, maintaining its stability is paramount. A standard battery charger is insufficient; a Clean Power Supply (PSU) capable of maintaining a constant 13.5V at up to 50 Amps is required. The voltage must not fluctuate during the 12-minute wait or the data writing phase.
* Server Availability: Before attempting AKL, check the status of the aftermarket tool's server. If the "GM Server Calculation" service is down for maintenance (which happens occasionally), the job cannot be completed.
7. Troubleshooting and Advanced Diagnostics
7.1. Communication Failure ("No VIN Detected")
The most common error encountered is the inability of the tool to communicate with the vehicle.
* Root Cause 1: Lack of CAN FD. If using a J2534 tool or older scanner without CAN FD hardware, this error is guaranteed. Verify hardware specifications.
* Root Cause 2: Gateway Lockout. If the vehicle is in a "Theft Deterrent" mode, the Secure Gateway Module may reject diagnostic requests. In some cases, disconnecting the vehicle battery for 15 minutes (hard reset) can reset the gateway logic.
* Root Cause 3: Physical Connection. The OBD ports on the T1 platform can be tight. Ensure the connector is fully seated.
7.2. "Remote Not Detected" in Pocket
* Pocket Location: Re-verify the pocket location. On bench seat models, it is easy to place the key in the wrong part of the under-seat storage. It must be in the molded depression.
* RF Interference: The 433 MHz frequency is susceptible to interference from cheap LED headlight bulbs, dash cams, or phone chargers. Unplug all aftermarket accessories.
* Battery Voltage: Even a new key should be checked. If the CR2450 measures below 3.0V, the inductive coupling might be too weak for the data burst required during learning.
7.3. "Learning Failed"
* Used Key: If the key was previously programmed to another vehicle, the ID49 chip is locked. The BCM will reject it during the final handshake. Only "virgin" or properly unlocked keys will work.
* Wrong FCC: Ensuring the key is YG0G21TB2 is critical. A visually identical key with a different FCC ID (e.g., from a different GM platform) will not be recognized.
8. Aftermarket Ecosystem and Future Outlook
The market for 2024 Silverado keys is bifurcated between high-cost OEM replacements and emerging aftermarket solutions.
* Xhorse XM38: The Xhorse XM38 Universal Smart Key has proven to be a reliable aftermarket alternative. Using a tool like the Key Tool Max, a technician can generate the "Chevrolet Silverado 2022+ ID49" firmware onto the XM38 board. Once generated, this key mimics the OEM signal and can be programmed using the standard diagnostic procedures. This offers a significant cost savings over the OEM fob.
* KeyDIY: KeyDIY also supports the platform, but Xhorse currently enjoys wider adoption for Global B simulation due to more frequent firmware updates.
* HP Tuners and ECU Locking: The complexity of the Global B security extends to the Engine Control Module (ECM). As noted in the tuning community, the Global B ECM (E99) is encrypted and "locked" from the factory. Companies like HP Tuners offer an "Unlock Service" which physically modifies the ECM to allow tuning. This is relevant to locksmiths because if an ECM is replaced, it must be digitally "married" to the BCM and keys. If a used ECM is installed without this unlocking/resetting process, the keys will not work, and the vehicle will not start, regardless of successful key programming.
9. Conclusion
The 2024 Chevrolet Silverado Smart Key system serves as a case study in the modern automotive security landscape. It combines the rigorous data protection of the Global B architecture with the physical durability of the HU100 mechanical interface. For the service professional, the era of simple "plug-and-play" key programming is over. Success now requires a synergistic approach: utilizing CAN FD-equipped hardware, maintaining robust internet and power infrastructure for server-side authentication, and possessing a nuanced understanding of the part number ecosystem. Whether utilizing the OEM SPS2 pipeline or advanced aftermarket solutions, the technician's ability to navigate the digital handshake of the 2024 Silverado is the defining skill of the new generation of automotive locksmithing.

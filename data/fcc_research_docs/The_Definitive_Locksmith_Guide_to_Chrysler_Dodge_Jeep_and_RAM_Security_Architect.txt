The Definitive Locksmith Guide to Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and RAM Security Architectures (1998–2025)
1. Executive Summary and Strategic Overview
The automotive security landscape of the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), now Stellantis, ecosystem represents one of the most dynamic and complex evolutions in the locksmithing domain. Unlike the consistent, linear progression seen in Ford’s Passive Anti-Theft System (PATS) or the deeply entrenched cryptographic consensus of Mercedes-Benz’s Drive Authorization System (DAS), the security architecture of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and RAM (CDJR) vehicles is defined by distinct eras of technological adoption, often influenced by the corporate ownership of the time.
From the early implementations of the Sentry Key Immobilizer Module (SKIM) under the Daimler-Chrysler partnership—which borrowed heavily from European transponder logic—to the modern, high-security implementations of the Radio Frequency Hub (RFH) and Security Gateway (SGW) modules under the Stellantis umbrella, the CDJR fleet demands a multifaceted diagnostic approach. For the professional locksmith, mastering this ecosystem requires not only an understanding of basic transponder programming but also a proficiency in handling the notorious "Rolling Code" PIN algorithms, navigating physical firewalls, and managing the delicate interplay between the Body Control Module (BCM) and the RF Hub.
This comprehensive research report serves as the definitive technical reference for the CDJR market. It dissects the operational theory of the four major immobilizer generations (SKIM, SKREEM, WIN, and RFH), details the cryptographic imperatives of PIN code extraction in the "Rolling Code" era, and provides granular programming procedures for dealing with the modern Security Gateway. Furthermore, this analysis integrates a comparative study of industry standards, contrasting CDJR’s protocols with the specific architectures of Nissan, Ford, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Hyundai to highlight the unique operational requirements of the Stellantis fleet. By understanding these divergent engineering philosophies—such as CDJR’s reliance on physical bypass cables for SGW access versus Hyundai’s digital certificate model—the locksmith gains the diagnostic intuition necessary to resolve complex "All Keys Lost" (AKL) scenarios and module failures.

2. Immobilizer System Architecture and Theoretical Evolution
To master CDJR key programming, one must first map the vehicle’s production year to its specific immobilizer architecture. The evolution of these systems is not merely a change in part numbers but a fundamental shift in how the vehicle authorizes a start request.
2.1 The Era of Static Codes: SKIM and SKREEM (1998–2010)
The genesis of modern CDJR security began with the Sentry Key Immobilizer Module (SKIM). This system introduced the concept of the "Sentry Key," a transponder-equipped key that communicated with a dedicated immobilizer ring located around the ignition cylinder.
The Sentry Key Immobilizer Module (SKIM)
The SKIM architecture, prevalent in vehicles like the early Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ), Dodge Ram (BE/BR), and Chrysler Sebring, established the foundational "Challenge-Response" logic used by the manufacturer.
* Operational Theory: When the ignition is turned, the SKIM energizes the transponder coil. The chip (typically an ID64 or early ID46) transmits a fixed alphanumeric ID. The SKIM verifies this ID against its internal EEPROM. If valid, the SKIM sends a "Fuel Enable" message to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) via the PCI (Programmable Communications Interface) bus.
* PIN Code Logic: Unlike the Ford PATS system of the same era, which often utilized a timed access (10-minute delay) for key programming 1, the SKIM system relied on a static 4-digit PIN code. This PIN was assigned to the vehicle at the factory and stored in the SKIM.
* Industry Comparison: This approach contrasts with the early Nissan NATS 5 systems, which also used a static PIN but allowed for calculation via the BCM label.1 In the CDJR ecosystem, the PIN was rarely calculable from external labels and typically required extraction from the dealer database or direct EEPROM reading of the Motorola MC68HC microcontroller within the SKIM unit.
The Sentry Key Remote Entry Module (SKREEM)
As remote keyless entry (RKE) became standard, engineers integrated the immobilizer and RKE receiver into a single unit: the SKREEM.
* Architecture: The SKREEM (Sentry Key Remote Entry Module) captures both the low-frequency (125 kHz) transponder signal and the high-frequency (315/433 MHz) remote signal. This integration reduced component count but introduced a single point of failure. If the SKREEM module fails—a common occurrence on the Crossfire and Sprinter platforms (which share DNA with the Mercedes SLK R170)—the vehicle is rendered immobile.
* Transponder Evolution: This era solidified the use of the Philips PCF7936 (ID46) chip. Much like the Nissan NATS 6 and Hyundai SMARTRA-3 systems 1, the CDJR implementation of ID46 locks the chip to the specific vehicle family (Crypto Mode) once programmed. A standard "virgin" PCF7936 can often be used for Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Hyundai, or Nissan applications, provided it is configured correctly by the programming tool prior to the "Learn" command.
2.2 The Daimler Legacy: Wireless Ignition Node (WIN) and Fobik (2008–2014)
The "Fobik" era represents the most visible influence of the Daimler-Chrysler partnership. The Wireless Ignition Node (WIN) is functionally and mechanically similar to the Mercedes-Benz Electronic Ignition Switch (EIS).1
* Hardware Design: The WIN eliminates the mechanical key blade for ignition turning. Instead, the user inserts a "Fobik" (Finger Operated Button Integrated Key)—a plastic rectangular fob—into the dash slot. The fob acts as the key, turning the rotary switch inside the WIN.
* Security Architecture: The WIN reads the transponder data (now integrated into the circuit board of the Fobik) and communicates with the PCM. However, unlike the sophisticated Hash-based consensus of the Mercedes DAS 3 system which requires all modules to agree 1, the WIN system remained PIN-based. Accessing the programming function still required the 4-digit PIN code.
* Critical Failure Points: The WIN modules on the Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country (2008–2010) are notorious for mechanical detent failure. The module may fail to detect the Fobik insertion or may allow the Fobik to fall out of the "Run" position while driving (leading to the massive P57 safety recall).
* Diagnostic Nuance: In a failure scenario, the symptoms often mimic a dead battery or starter failure. The locksmith must differentiate between a WIN that has lost communication (No Bus) and a WIN that simply cannot mechanically engage the ignition switch.
2.3 The Modern Era: Radio Frequency Hub (RFH) and Keyless Go (2011–Present)
With the introduction of the "Keyless Go" (Push-To-Start) systems, the immobilizer function migrated to the Radio Frequency Hub (RF Hub or RFH). This is the current standard for the majority of the fleet, including the RAM 1500, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Dodge Charger.
* The RF Hub Function: The RFH is a sophisticated receiver located (typically) on the rear cab wall of trucks or under the rear shelf of sedans. It manages the passive entry antennas, the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), and the remote start authorization.
* The "Keyless" Handshake: When the user presses the Start Button, the RFH polls the cabin antennas to triangulate the key's location. If the key is detected inside the vehicle, the RFH authorizes the Body Control Module (BCM) to energize the Ignition Node (KIN/IGN) and tells the PCM to fuel the engine.
* Rolling Code PINs: Starting around 2013, and becoming universal by 2018, CDJR shifted from static 4-digit PINs to 5-digit rolling codes on select platforms, and eventually to a system where the PIN is encrypted and rolling based on time and VIN. This evolution necessitated a constant internet connection for aftermarket tools to pull PIN codes from "cloud" servers, similar to the Nissan 20-digit rolling code evolution.1

3. Cryptography and PIN Code Management: The Rolling Code Era
The defining characteristic of modern CDJR locksmithing is the management of PIN codes. Unlike Ford, where access is often time-based (10-minute wait) 1, or Hyundai, where PINs can often be read directly via OBD 1, CDJR has implemented a strict "Read PIN" protocol that has become increasingly fortified.
3.1 Static vs. Rolling Codes
* Static Codes (Type 1/2): On vehicles prior to ~2013, the 4-digit PIN was fixed for the life of the car. It could be read from the WIN or SKREEM EEPROM or pulled via the dealer database (DealerConnect).
* Rolling Codes (Type 3/4/5): Modern RFH systems utilize a rolling code logic. The PIN required to enter programming mode changes.
   * The "Pull PIN" Requirement: Unlike Nissan’s BCM calculator where the tool calculates the PIN from a label 1, CDJR rolling codes are derived from a proprietary algorithm linked to the VIN. Aftermarket tools (AutoProPad, IM608, SmartPro) utilize "credits" or background server calculations to pull this PIN.
   * System Lockout: Entering an incorrect PIN 3 times will lock the RF Hub for 1 hour. This is a critical risk during "Brute Force" attempts. This lockout behavior is identical to the Hyundai system's 1-hour penalty 1 and the Ford PATS 10-minute lockout.1
3.2 The RF Hub "Lock" Strategy (2020+)
On the newest platforms (e.g., Jeep Grand Cherokee L, Wagoneer), Stellantis has implemented a "Hub Lock." Once a key is programmed to the RF Hub, the Hub locks itself to the VIN and potentially blocks further PIN reading via OBD.
* The "All Keys Lost" Conundrum: In some 2021+ scenarios, if all keys are lost, the RF Hub cannot be unlocked to accept new keys via standard PIN methods. The "official" repair often involves replacing the RF Hub with a virgin unit.
* Comparison: This is effectively similar to the Mercedes FBS4 situation where modules cannot be reused or easily reprogrammed without dealer intervention 1, marking a departure from the historically open architecture of Chrysler.

4. The Security Gateway (SGW) Module: Hardware vs. Software Barriers
Perhaps the most significant disruption to the aftermarket locksmith industry in the last decade was the introduction of the Security Gateway (SGW) module in 2018. This module acts as a firewall between the diagnostic port (DLC) and the vehicle's internal CAN bus networks (CAN-C and CAN-IH).
4.1 The Mechanism of the Firewall
The SGW isolates the "Public" CAN bus (connected to the OBDII port) from the "Private" CAN bus (where the RFH, BCM, and PCM reside).
* Read-Only Access: An unauthorized tool connected to the OBDII port can read codes and live data but cannot write commands. Since key programming requires writing data (to add a Key ID), the SGW blocks the procedure.
* Industry Context: This architecture is mirrored across the industry but handled differently.
   * Nissan: Requires a "16+32" hardware cable to physically bypass the gateway on 2020+ Sentra/Rogue models.1
   * Hyundai/Kia: Uses a software-based approach where authorized tools exchange digital certificates with a server to gain access, requiring no physical bypass.1
   * Mercedes-Benz: Uses physical intervention on older Gateway cars (W164) or dealer-only servers for modern FBS4 systems.1
4.2 The "12+8" Bypass Method (Hardware)
For CDJR vehicles, the primary workaround for the SGW is the "12+8" cable method.
* Procedure: The locksmith must physically locate the SGW module (often behind the radio, glovebox, or speedometer cluster). The two connectors (12-pin and 8-pin) are unplugged from the SGW and plugged into a "Y-Cable" or directly into the diagnostic tool’s adapter.
* Result: This physically bypasses the firewall, connecting the tool directly to the internal CAN bus. This allows for unrestricted PIN reading and key programming.
* Vehicle Locations:
   * Dodge Charger/Challenger: Under the dash, driver side, near the steering column.
   * Jeep Wrangler JL: Behind the radio (requires dash disassembly) or accessible via the "Star Connector" bank behind the glovebox.
   * RAM 1500 (2019+): Behind the speedometer cluster or above the gas pedal (very difficult access).
4.3 The "AutoAuth" Method (Software)
Alternatively, locksmiths can utilize tools (like the Autel IM608 or SmartPro) registered with "AutoAuth."
* Mechanism: The tool connects to Wi-Fi, authenticates the user’s credentials with the AutoAuth server (which is partnered with Stellantis), and digitally "unlocks" the SGW via the OBDII port.
* Pros/Cons: This eliminates the need for dashboard disassembly but requires an active internet connection and an annual subscription fee.
4.4 The Star Connector Strategy
On many modern CDJR vehicles (Chrysler Pacifica, Jeep Compass), the CAN bus is distributed via "Star Connectors"—green (CAN-C) and white (CAN-IH) distribution blocks.
* The Backdoor: Instead of unplugging the SGW, a locksmith can plug a specialized "Star Connector Cable" directly into an open port on the Green Star Connector. This effectively grants direct access to the high-speed CAN bus, bypassing the SGW entirely. This is often faster than digging for the SGW module itself.

5. Transponder Chip Specifications and Keyway Profiles
CDJR has utilized a diverse array of transponder technologies, shifting from simple magnetic coupling to high-security AES encryption.
5.1 Transponder Evolution Table
Era
	System
	Transponder Type
	Keyway
	Models
	1998–2004
	SKIM (Early)
	ID64 (4E) / ID46

	2018–2025
	RFH (AES)
	HITAG AES (4A)
	SIP22 / Y159
	Wrangler JL, Ram DT, Pacifica
	5.2 The Shift to SIP22 and HITAG AES
The most significant recent change is the adoption of the "SIP22" keyway and HITAG AES (4A) transponders on models like the Jeep Renegade, Ram ProMaster, and Jeep Compass.
* Fiat Influence: The SIP22 keyway is a laser-cut (milled) high-security track, originally a Fiat design. This marks a departure from the traditional double-sided "Y159" edge-cut keys used by Chrysler for decades.
* Encryption: The HITAG AES chips (ID4A) operate on 128-bit encryption. Similar to the transition seen in the BMW G-Series 1 and Nissan’s 2019+ models 1, these chips are extremely difficult to clone. "All Keys Lost" procedures require generating a dealer key via OBD, utilizing the SGW bypass.
5.3 Fobik vs. Pod Key
* Fobik: The plastic rectangular key used in WIN modules.
* Pod Key: A traditional-looking key with a Fobik-style head, used in lower-trim vehicles (like the RAM ST tradesman trucks) that have a WIN module but no RKE buttons.
* Interchangeability: A Pod Key can typically start a vehicle designed for a Fobik, provided the transponder ID is programmed. However, the Fobik functions (buttons) will obviously be absent.

6. Comprehensive Programming Procedures and Tool Walkthroughs
The following procedures outline the best practices for programming CDJR vehicles using industry-standard tools like the Autel IM608 and Advanced Diagnostics SmartPro.
6.1 Scenario A: 2015 Dodge Ram 1500 (RFH/Keyless Go) - All Keys Lost
* System: Radio Frequency Hub (RFH) with ID46 Proximity Key.
* Prerequisites: Valid PIN code (read via tool), Battery voltage > 12.5V.
* Tool Path (Autel): IMMO > Chrysler > Selection > RAM > 2013-2017 > Smart Key.
1. Read PIN: Select "Read Immobilizer Password." The tool will query the RFH. On a 2015, this is typically successful via OBD without a bypass. Record the 4-digit PIN.
2. Erase Keys: (Optional but recommended for AKL). Select "Erase all keys." This ensures lost keys cannot start the truck.
3. Add Key: Select "Add Smart Key."
4. Procedure: The tool will prompt to press the "Unlock" button on the new smart key while holding it near the center console (or pressing the Start button with the fob nose).
5. Verification: The dash will display "Key Learned." Test proximity unlock and push-to-start functions.
6.2 Scenario B: 2020 Jeep Wrangler JL (SGW + SIP22) - Add Key
* System: RFH with Security Gateway and HITAG AES (4A) Key.
* Challenge: The SGW blocks OBD programming.
* Hardware Prep:
   * Locate the "Star Connector" bank behind the glovebox (passenger side).
   * Disconnect the two OEM connectors from the Green (CAN-C) block.
   * Connect the "12+8" or "Star Connector" adapter cable into the Star Connector block and the programming tool.
* Tool Path (Autel): IMMO > Jeep > Wrangler JL > 2018-2021 > Smart Key.
1. Read PIN: Select "Read PIN Code." The tool will pull the PIN from the RFH via the direct CAN connection.
2. Program Key: Select "Add Smart Key."
3. Sequence: Hold the new key against the Start Button. Press the button with the key nose.
4. Confirmation: The cluster will update the key count.
5. Reassembly: Disconnect the bypass cable and reconnect the OEM Star Connectors. Verify the vehicle starts without the tool connected.
6.3 Scenario C: 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan (WIN/Fobik) - WIN Module Failure
* Symptom: Vehicle does not crank. Fobik does not rotate in the switch.
* Diagnosis:
   * Connect scanner. Attempt to read "WIN Module" live data.
   * If "No Communication," check power/ground to WIN.
   * If Communicating, check "Ignition Switch Status." If status does not change when Fobik is inserted, the WIN detents are likely broken.
* Repair: Replace WIN Module.
* Programming (Replacement WIN):
   1. Install: Install new WIN module.
   2. Transfer Secret: Use "Replace WIN" function. The tool will attempt to read the SKIM Secret Key (SSK) from the PCM and write it to the new WIN. This avoids needing to replace existing keys.
   3. If Transfer Fails: You must program the WIN as "New." This requires the vehicle's original PIN (from dealer) and new Fobiks, as used Fobiks are locked to the old WIN configuration.

7. Comparisons with Global Industry Standards
Understanding CDJR security becomes clearer when contrasted with the competing architectures detailed in the provided research data.
7.1 SGW Implementation: CDJR vs. Hyundai vs. Nissan
The approach to the 2018+ Security Gateway creates distinct workflows:
* CDJR (12+8 Bypass): The primary method is physical. The locksmith is expected to remove panels and plug in cables. This is labor-intensive but reliable and does not strictly require an internet subscription if the tool has offline protocols.
* Hyundai/Kia (Digital Certs): As noted in the Hyundai research 1, the SGW does not require hardware bypass. It is purely a software handshake. This is cleaner but makes the locksmith 100% dependent on the tool manufacturer's server uptime and subscription status.
* Nissan (16+32 Cable): Nissan’s approach 1 on the 2020+ Sentra mirrors the CDJR method (physical bypass), confirming a trend among manufacturers who do not have a robust "AutoAuth" style partnership with the aftermarket.
7.2 Rolling Code Complexity: CDJR vs. BMW
* CDJR Rolling Codes: While CDJR rolling PINs require server calculation, they are generally valid for a session. The RF Hub acts as the primary gatekeeper.
* BMW ISN: In contrast, BMW’s "Rolling Code" logic between the CAS and DME is a continuous synchronization. Furthermore, the BMW ISN (Individual Serial Number) is a 128-bit hex string 1 that is significantly more complex than the 4-digit or 5-digit PINs used by CDJR. CDJR security relies on access (the Gateway), whereas BMW security relies on cryptography (the ISN).
7.3 Key "Locking" logic: CDJR vs. Mercedes
* Mercedes FBS4: Once a key is programmed, it is practically impossible to reuse or unlock for another vehicle.1
* CDJR Fobiks/Prox: Similarly, modern CDJR keys (Hitag 2 and Hitag AES) lock the "Remote" and "Keyless" pages to the vehicle configuration. While the transponder data might be rewriteable on some generic chips, OEM keys are typically one-time use. This similarity reinforces the "Europeanization" of CDJR security protocols following the Daimler era.
________________
8. Lishi Decoding and Mechanical Lock Systems
While the WIN module eliminated the ignition cylinder, door locks remain mechanical, necessitating traditional locksmith skills for "Lockout" and "All Keys Lost" key generation.
8.1 The CY24 / Y159 Keyway
* Profile: An 8-cut, double-sided edge key.
* Lishi Tool: CY24 (2-in-1).
* Picking Strategy: This is a standard wafer lock. Some wafers are split (1-up/1-down). The CY24 Lishi is generally user-friendly.
* Application: Older Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep, and current heavy-duty trucks (RAM 2500/3500 door locks).
8.2 The SIP22 Keyway
* Profile: A high-security, laser-cut track key (milled).
* Lishi Tool: SIP22 (2-in-1).
* Picking Strategy: This lock requires distinct tension. It is common on the Jeep Renegade, Ram ProMaster, and newer Jeep Compass.
* Decoding Nuance: The SIP22 lock on ProMasters is notoriously stiff. The Lishi tool risks bending if over-torqued.
8.3 The High-Security "Emergency" Blade (Y159-HS)
* Profile: Used in the "Pod" keys and Smart Keys for Chargers/Challengers.
* Lishi Tool: CY24 (often works) or specific Y159 decoders.
* Note: Many modern CDJR door locks utilize a "clutch" mechanism. If picked in the wrong direction, the cylinder spins freely without unlocking the door.
________________
9. Conclusion and Future Outlook
The trajectory of CDJR security architecture is clear: a move toward total isolation of the security modules from the open diagnostic bus. The progression from the open SKIM systems to the firewalled SGW modules demonstrates a defensive engineering posture.
For the professional locksmith, the future of servicing the Stellantis fleet lies in:
1. Hardware Proficiency: Mastering the physical access points for the SGW bypass (Star Connectors, RFH plugs).
2. Digital Authorization: Maintaining active credentials with AutoAuth and NASTF to perform legitimate programming without dashboard disassembly.
3. Component Replacement: As RF Hubs become VIN-locked in the "Hub Lock" era (2021+), the trade will shift from simple "Key Adding" to complex "Module Replacement and Restore" procedures, mirroring the high-level bench work currently required for BMW 1 and Mercedes 1 vehicles.

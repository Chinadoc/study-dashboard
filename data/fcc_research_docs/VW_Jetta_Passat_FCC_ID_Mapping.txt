The Definitive Technical Analysis of Volkswagen Immobilizer IV Remote Systems: Jetta (Mk5) and Passat (B6/B7)
1. Introduction: The Evolution of VAG Security Architectures
The automotive security landscape underwent a seismic shift in the mid-2000s, a transformation epitomized by the engineering decisions made by Volkswagen AG (VAG) during the development of the PQ35 (Jetta Mk5) and PQ46 (Passat B6) platforms. For automotive locksmiths, security integrators, and technical historians, the period between 2006 and 2014 represents the "Golden Era" of the Fourth Generation Immobilizer (Immo4). This report serves as an exhaustive technical reference, deconstructing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) identifier mappings, part number supersession logic, and transponder protocols for the Volkswagen Jetta (2006–2010) and Volkswagen Passat (2006–2014).
Understanding these systems requires more than a superficial list of part numbers. It necessitates a deep comprehension of the underlying architectural divergence that occurred during this period. While the Jetta retained the traditional instrument-cluster-centric immobilizer topology, the Passat B6 introduced a radical, decentralized architecture centered on the Comfort Control Module (CCM). This divergence created two distinct ecosystems of remote hardware—the ubiquitous "Flip Key" and the proprietary "Slot Key"—that continue to challenge aftermarket support channels to this day.
This analysis is grounded in a rigorous examination of technical datasheets, OEM parts catalogs (ETKA), and empirical data from the locksmithing community. It addresses the critical distinctions between North American Region (NAR) frequencies (315 MHz) and Rest of World (ROW) specifications, the complex hierarchy of part number suffixes (e.g., the "AM" vs. "P" debate), and the intricate operational parameters of the Megamos Crypto 48 (ID48) CAN-bus transponder system.
1.1 The Immo4 Paradigm Shift
To appreciate the specificity of the FCC IDs discussed in this report, one must first understand the environment in which they operate. The Immo4 system marked the transition from static, fixed-code transponders to dynamic, pre-coded security. In previous generations (Immo2/Immo3), a blank transponder could often be adapted to the vehicle with a simple PIN code (Login Code). The Immo4 architecture introduced Component Security (CS), a 7-byte (and later 12-byte) hexadecimal string unique to the vehicle's Engine Control Unit (ECU) and immobilizer master.
This architectural requirement means that every key fob discussed herein—whether for a 2006 Jetta or a 2014 Passat—is not merely a radio transmitter. It is a cryptographic device that must be pre-loaded with specific vehicle data before it can be authorized via the On-Board Diagnostics (OBDII) port. This fusion of remote entry functions and immobilizer security within the same hardware package (the key fob) created a dependency where the correct FCC ID dictates not just remote locking capabilities, but the fundamental ability to start the engine.


  



2. Theoretical Framework: Frequency and Modulation
The fundamental compatibility of any automotive remote is governed by its radio frequency (RF) characteristics. For the vehicles in scope, the distinction is strictly regional, yet it remains the most common source of procurement error.
2.1 The 315 MHz Standard (North American Region)
The research unequivocally establishes that the 2006–2010 Jetta and 2006–2014 Passat models delivered to the North American market operate on the 315 MHz band.1 This frequency allocation is mandated by FCC regulations for short-range devices (SRD) in the United States and Industry Canada (IC) regulations.
Conversely, the European variants of these same vehicles (Jetta A5 and Passat B6/B7) typically operate on 433.92 MHz (often rounded to 433 MHz or 434 MHz). It is critical to note that the physical shells, button layouts, and even the "heft" of the keys are often indistinguishable between regions. The differentiation lies entirely in the surface-mounted oscillating crystals and antenna matching networks on the printed circuit board (PCB). An FCC ID starting with NBG (e.g., NBG92596263) acts as a definitive marker for the 315 MHz equipment authorized for US use.1 Attempting to program a 433 MHz key 23 to a US-spec Jetta will result in a successful immobilizer programming (since the ID48 chip is frequency-independent) but a complete failure of the remote keyless entry (RKE) functions.
2.2 Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
The modulation scheme employed across the Immo4 platform is Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK). In this modulation technique, the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied to represent binary data—essentially turning the carrier "on" and "off" to transmit the lock/unlock commands. While later VW platforms (MQB) eventually introduced Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) for greater noise immunity, the Mk5 Jetta and B6/B7 Passat rely on ASK. This technical detail is vital when utilizing universal remote generators (such as the Xhorse or KeyDIY systems), where the technician must manually select between ASK and FSK profiles. For all FCC IDs covered in this report (NBG92596263, NBG009066T, NBG010180T), ASK is the required protocol.
3. The Volkswagen Jetta Mk5 (2005.5–2010): The Integrated Flip Key Ecosystem
The introduction of the fifth-generation Jetta (Mk5) in mid-2005 brought European refinement to the compact sedan market. Along with the multi-link rear suspension and electromechanical steering came a standardized, high-security remote system. Unlike the Passat, which would diverge into a slot-based system, the Jetta Mk5 refined the proven "switchblade" or "flip key" design established in the Mk4 generation.
3.1 Anatomy of the Mk5 Key
The Jetta Mk5 key is a multipart assembly consisting of:
1. The Remote Head (Transmitter): Containing the PCB, battery, and buttons.
2. The Key Blade: Utilizing the HU66 profile (high security, internal cut).1
3. The Transponder: An ID48 Megamos Crypto glass capsule glued into the mechanical key head, or in later revisions, a coil integrated onto the remote PCB.
The integration of these components defines the user experience. The "flip" mechanism allows the potentially jagged key blade to be retracted, preventing damage to pocket linings—a hallmark of VW design since the late 1990s.
3.2 The Dominant Identifier: FCC ID NBG92596263
The research identifies NBG92596263 as the singular, dominant FCC identifier for the Mk5 Jetta remote.1 This ID is associated with the internal Hella or Siemens circuitry operating at 315 MHz.
* IC (Industry Canada) ID: 2694A-92596263.1
* Button Configuration: 4-Button (Lock, Unlock, Trunk, Panic). The Panic button is located on the side of the remote shell in US models, a mandatory safety feature for NAR vehicles that is often absent in European spec keys.
3.3 The Part Number Labyrinth: "P" vs. "AM" vs. "H"
The most complex aspect of the Jetta Mk5 key ecosystem is the supersession of OEM part numbers. Volkswagen's parts catalog, ETKA, is notorious for replacing part numbers as vendors change or minor internal improvements are made. For the locksmith or parts manager, knowing which part number is the "master" is essential.
The Supremacy of 1K0 959 753 P
The research confirms that 1K0 959 753 P is the "Golden Part Number" for the 2006–2010 Jetta.4
* Why "P"? The "P" revision appears to be the final, most stable iteration of the 315 MHz remote for the Mk5 platform. It is backward compatible with earlier Mk5 revisions.
* The "H" Variant: Early production models (2005.5–2006) often shipped with 1K0 959 753 H.1 Physically and electronically, the 'H' and 'P' remotes are functionally identical for the end-user. However, the 'P' suffix is the standard replacement stocked by vendors like Royal Key Supply and Locksmith Keyless.1
The "AM" Confusion: 1J0 vs. 1K0
A significant potential for error exists regarding the "AM" suffix. The snippets reference both 1K0 959 753 AM and 1J0 959 753 AM.7
* 1J0 (Mk4 Platform): The 1J0 prefix denotes the fourth-generation chassis (Golf/Jetta 1999–2005). Keys with 1J0 part numbers are designed for the Immo3 system and the older Central Convenience Module. They are not compatible with the Mk5's CAN-bus based Central Electronics Module, despite possibly sharing the 315 MHz frequency.7
* 1K0 (Mk5 Platform): The 1K0 prefix denotes the fifth-generation chassis. If a 1K0 959 753 AM exists, it would be a specific revision for the Mk5. However, the research overwhelmingly points to 1K0 959 753 P as the correct current specification.
* The Verdict: When sourcing keys for a 2006–2010 Jetta, technicians must rigorously verify the 1K0 prefix. Using a 1J0 key is a common cause of "remote programming failure" where the key starts the car (if the chip is correct) but the buttons refuse to sync.


  



3.4 The Absence of KESSY in Jetta Mk5
It is crucial to address the presence—or lack thereof—of Smart Key features in the Mk5 Jetta. The research snippets confirm that the 2006–2010 Jetta Mk5 was predominantly, if not exclusively, a mechanical ignition vehicle in the North American market.8 While the trunk could be opened electronically, the "KESSY" (Keyless Access Start and Exit System) features found in the Touareg and Phaeton of the same era did not migrate down to the Jetta class until the Mk6 generation (2011+). Therefore, FCC ID NBG92596263 is strictly a remote keyless entry device, not a proximity token. Technicians should not attempt to sell or program "Smart Keys" or "Push to Start" fobs for the 2006–2010 Jetta, as the vehicle lacks the necessary LF antennas and Start/Stop authorization module.
4. The Volkswagen Passat B6 (2006–2010): The CCM Revolution
If the Jetta Mk5 was an evolution, the Passat B6 (2006–2010) was a revolution. Abandoning the shared platform strategy of the B5 (which was essentially an Audi A4), the B6 utilized a stretched version of the Golf platform (PQ46) but introduced a completely novel immobilizer architecture. This system is the source of significant confusion in the aftermarket due to its unique "Slot Key" form factor.
4.1 The Slot Key (Fobik) Architecture
The Passat B6 does not use a traditional metal key blade for ignition. Instead, the entire plastic fob is inserted into a reader slot in the dashboard. The user pushes the fob in to start the engine. This system is technically referred to as the Electronic Ignition Lock (D9).
* Immobilizer Master: Unlike the Jetta, where the instrument cluster holds the master immobilizer data, the Passat B6 delegates this role to the Comfort Control Module (CCM) located behind the glovebox (Component J393).
* Electronic Steering Column Lock (ESCL): The CCM communicates with the ESCL (Component N360) via the CAN bus. Authorization requires a handshake between the Key, the CCM, the ESCL, and the ECU. This complex chain makes the B6 Passat one of the most difficult vehicles for "All Keys Lost" programming, often requiring the physical removal of the CCM to read the 95320 EEPROM.
4.2 The Universal Identifier: FCC ID NBG009066T
Despite the complexity of the vehicle's internal networks, the radio frequency interface is consolidated under a single FCC ID: NBG009066T.2
* Scope: This ID covers the entire B6 Passat range (2006–2010) and the Volkswagen CC (2009–2014).
* Frequency: 315 MHz.
* Chip Type: Megamos 48 CAN.9 Unlike the Jetta's glass capsule, the Passat's transponder coil is soldered directly onto the PCB, making chip replacement difficult without microsoldering skills.
4.3 The Critical Dichotomy: Half-Smart vs. Full-Smart
The FCC ID NBG009066T acts as an umbrella for two distinct functional tiers of keys. Visually, they are often identical. Functionally, they are worlds apart. The distinction is determined by the presence of the KESSY system.
4.3.1 The "Half-Smart" (Non-Proximity) Key
This is the standard key for the majority of Passat B6 models (Value Edition, 2.0T base).
* Function: The key has remote buttons for door locks, but must be inserted into the dash slot to start the car. It does not transmit a proximity signal for ignition.
* Part Number Suffixes: The research identifies a long chain of superseding part numbers for this variant: 3C0 959 752 N, 3C0 959 752 BB, 3C0 959 752 AE, 3C0 959 752 AM.10
* The "BA" Designator: In the aftermarket, the 3C0 959 752 BA part number is frequently cited as the specific identifier for the non-proximity version.12
4.3.2 The "Full-Smart" (Proximity/KESSY) Key
This key was supplied with high-trim models (VR6, Highline, SEL).
* Function: The key can remain in the driver's pocket. The car utilizes Low-Frequency (LF) antennas to detect the key. The driver starts the car by pressing the dash slot (which acts as a button) or a separate Start/Stop button.
* Part Number Suffix: The definitive identifier for this variant is 3C0 959 752 BG.12
* The "BG" Difference: Research snippet 14 explicitly warns: "If it's different from 3C0 959 752 BG, please don't order." This suggests that the BG internal architecture contains the necessary LF wakeup coil and proximity logic that the BA keys lack. While they share the NBG009066T FCC ID, a BA key will not program as a proximity key. It might start the car if inserted, but the "keyless" features will fail.


  



4.4 The "Comfort Coupe" (CC) Overlap
The Volkswagen CC (originally the Passat CC) shares the B6 platform architecture. From 2009 to 2014, the CC utilized the same NBG009066T keys as the B6 Passat.2 This means the BA vs. BG logic applies equally to the CC. Even though the Passat sedan moved to the B7/NMS platform in 2012, the CC continued on the B6-derived architecture until the end of its lifecycle, maintaining the use of the Slot Key system long after the sedan reverted to the Flip Key.
5. The Volkswagen Passat NMS (2012–2014): The Return of the Flip Key
In 2012, Volkswagen of America introduced the "New Midsize Sedan" (NMS) Passat, designated internally as the B7 (though structurally distinct from the European B7). Designed specifically for the US market and built in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the NMS Passat prioritized cost-effectiveness and familiar ergonomics. Consequently, the complex and expensive "Slot Key" system of the B6 was abandoned in favor of a return to the robust Flip Key architecture, similar to the Jetta Mk6.
5.1 Divergence from European B7
It is vital to distinguish the NMS Passat from the European B7 Passat. The European B7 retained the Slot Key (Fobik) system of the B6. The US NMS Passat uses a traditional bladed key. Sourcing a key for a "2013 Passat" requires knowing the region; a US technician ordering a European "B7" key will receive a Slot Key that is physically incompatible with the NMS ignition cylinder.
5.2 The 5K0 Platform and Dual FCC IDs
The NMS Passat adopts the 5K0 part number nomenclature, originally debuting with the Golf Mk6. For the 2012–2014 model years, the research identifies two distinct FCC IDs, again split by the presence of Proximity (Push-Button Start) features.
5.2.1 The Standard Flip Key (Non-Prox): FCC ID NBG010180T
For the S and SE trim levels, which utilize a traditional mechanical ignition cylinder:
* FCC ID: NBG010180T.15
* Primary Part Numbers: 5K0 837 202 AE and 5K0 837 202 R.16
* Function: Standard remote keyless entry. The key blade must be turned to start the car.
* Chip: ID48 CAN (Immo4).
* Frequency: 315 MHz.
5.2.2 The Smart Flip Key (KESSY): FCC ID NBG010206T
For the SEL and Premium trim levels equipped with a Push-Button Start (located on the center console near the shifter):
* FCC ID: NBG010206T.17
* Primary Part Number: 5K0 837 202 AK.17
* Visual Identification: These keys look virtually identical to the Non-Prox versions. They are both Flip Keys with blades. However, the KESSY version allows the user to leave the key in their pocket and start the car via the button.
* Technical Distinction: Snippet 22 is explicit: "This remote is ONLY for vehicles with the Push Button Start feature." The NBG010206T contains additional 125 kHz Low-Frequency (LF) receiver coils on the PCB to communicate with the car's KESSY antennas.
* Emergency Start: If the battery in the NBG010206T fails, the user must hold the key fob against a designated spot on the steering column (the "emergency coil" location) to induce the transponder for starting.
5.3 Supersession and Compatibility
The 5K0 series keys show a clear supersession path. The AK suffix is the definitive KESSY part. The AE suffix is the definitive Non-KESSY part. Mixing these will result in partial functionality (e.g., the car may start if the blade is turned, but the Push-Button start will not work if the wrong key is used).
6. Aftermarket Implications and Programming Diagnostics
The transition to Immo4 and the specific FCC IDs detailed above created a complex aftermarket landscape. Programming these keys is not a DIY task; it requires specialized locksmithing equipment (e.g., AVDI, VVDI2, Zed-Full, or Autel IM508/608).
6.1 The "Used Key" Problem
A critical characteristic of the ID48 CAN system is that the transponder chip is "locked" to the vehicle once programmed.
* Jetta Mk5: The glass ID48 chip is locked. A used key cannot be reprogrammed to a second Jetta unless the glass chip is replaced with a new, virgin ID48 chip. This makes refurbishing Jetta keys relatively easy and cost-effective.
* Passat B6: The transponder is part of the PCB. "Unlocking" a used Passat B6 remote requires desoldering components or using high-end tools to reset the firmware on the microcontroller. Consequently, the supply of cheap, used OEM keys for the Passat B6 is much lower than for the Jetta.
6.2 Pre-Coding Requirements
Unlike older Fords or Toyotas where a generic key is accepted, the Immo4 system requires the dealer or locksmith to "Pre-Code" the specific Component Security (CS) bytes onto the key before the final adaptation.
* The Dealer Method: Dealers order keys from the Depot based on the VIN. The key arrives pre-cut and pre-coded with the specific CS for that car.
* The Locksmith Method: The locksmith uses a tool to read the CS bytes from the car's cluster or CCM via OBDII. They then write these bytes to a blank ID48 chip. Only then can the key be "learned" to the car. This explains why buying a "ready to program" key online often fails for DIY users; they lack the tool to perform the pre-coding step.
6.3 Frequency Clashes
The global nature of online marketplaces has flooded the US market with European-spec keys.
* US Spec: 315 MHz (FCC ID: NBG...).
* EU Spec: 433/434 MHz (Part numbers often ending in different suffixes like AD or AG).
* The Trap: A 433 MHz key key will program to the immobilizer (since the ID48 chip is passive and frequency-independent). The car will start. However, the remote buttons will never work. This "Start but no Remote" symptom is the #1 indicator of an incorrect FCC ID selection.
7. Conclusion: A Data-Driven Summary
The 2006–2014 era for Volkswagen Jetta and Passat models represents a fascinating bifurcation in automotive security design. The Jetta Mk5 adhered to a traditional, robust Flip Key architecture centered on the Instrument Cluster and the 1K0 959 753 P part number. The Passat B6, in contrast, pioneered a complex, decentralized Slot Key system managed by the Comfort Control Module, introducing the BA (Standard) and BG (Smart) dichotomy. The Passat NMS eventually reconciled these differences in 2012 by returning to the Flip Key, albeit with updated 5K0 electronics.
For the professional, the key takeaways are:
1. Verify the Chassis: Confirm if the Passat is a B6 (Slot Key) or NMS (Flip Key).
2. Check for KESSY: Identify if the vehicle has Push-Button Start. This singular feature dictates the difference between a $50 key and a $150 key (e.g., BA vs BG, or AE vs AK).
3. Respect the Suffix: In the VAG world, the suffix is not a minor detail; it is the definition of the part's frequency and functionality.
4. Trust the FCC ID: NBG92596263 for Jetta Mk5, NBG009066T for Passat B6, and the NBG010... series for Passat NMS are the immutable constants in a sea of shifting part numbers.
By adhering to these mappings, the technician ensures not just a working key, but the preservation of the vehicle's integral security architecture.

Deep Research: Jeep Grand Cherokee WL (2021-2025) Immobilizer & Key Programming Protocols
1. Introduction: The WL Platform Architectural Shift
The introduction of the fifth-generation Jeep Grand Cherokee (WL platform), which debuted with the extended "L" model in 2021 and the standard two-row model in 2022, marks a definitive schism in automotive locksmithing for Stellantis vehicles. While externally similar to its predecessor, the WK2, the WL operates on the entirely new "Atlantis" electrical architecture. This shift is not merely an upgrade in processing speed but a fundamental restructuring of vehicle cybersecurity, driven by increasing regulatory pressure for cyber-secure vehicles (UNECE WP.29).
For the automotive locksmith and diagnostic technician, the implications are profound. The methods that defined the previous decade of Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep service—specifically the casual reading of PIN codes via the OBD-II port and the permissive nature of the Radio Frequency Hub (RF Hub)—are now obsolete and dangerous liabilities. The WL platform introduces a hardened Radio Frequency Hub Module (RFHM) that is aggressively defensive. Unlike previous iterations that would simply reject an incorrect security request, the WL RFHM frequently interprets unauthorized memory access attempts (common in aftermarket PIN reading) as a brute-force attack, triggering a bootloader lockdown that renders the vehicle immobile.
This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of the WL immobilizer system. It is designed to bridge the gap between official service literature, which assumes access to factory tools, and the reality of the aftermarket, where technicians must navigate Security Gateways (SGW), Star Connectors, and voltage-sensitive subsystems like Quadra-Lift air suspension. The data presented herein is derived from a synthesis of field reports, technical service bulletins, and direct analysis of tool capabilities as of early 2026.
1.1 The Operational Reality: Dealer vs. Aftermarket
A central theme of this research is the divergence between "possible" and "safe." While aftermarket tools such as the Autel IM608 Pro II or OBDSTAR series list coverage for the 2021+ Grand Cherokee WL, their capability is strictly conditional. The primary finding is that while programming a key is possible with aftermarket hardware, retrieving the credentials (the PIN code) via OBD is a high-risk operation that fails in over 40% of observed cases, often resulting in catastrophic module failure.1 Consequently, the WL platform is effectively "Dealer-Dependent" for the PIN code acquisition step, even if the final programming is performed independently.
2. Network Topology and the Security Gateway (SGW)
To understand why traditional procedures fail, one must visualize the WL's network topology. The vehicle utilizes a high-speed CAN-C (Controller Area Network C) for powertrain and chassis operations, and a CAN-IHS (Interior High Speed) for body electronics, including the RF Hub.
2.1 The Security Gateway Module (SGW)
Since 2018, FCA vehicles have been equipped with a Security Gateway Module (SGW). This module sits immediately behind the Data Link Connector (OBD-II port).
* Function: The SGW acts as a firewall. It allows unrestricted read traffic (so generic scan tools can read DTCs) but blocks all write commands (clearing codes, actuation tests, key programming) from tools that lack a digital certificate.2
* The "AutoAuth" Evolution: Modern internet-connected tools (Autel, Snap-On, Bosch) utilize "AutoAuth" to digitally handshake with the SGW. However, strictly relying on AutoAuth for key programming on the WL is discouraged by many high-level technicians. The digital bypass allows communication, but it routes the signal through the gateway, which can introduce latency or filtering that interferes with the delicate timing of the immobilizer handshake.
* Physical Bypass: The preferred method for key programming is a physical bypass. By connecting directly to the vehicle's internal bus, the tool operates with "root access," bypassing the SGW entirely.
2.2 The Star Connector: The Physical Backdoor
In the previous WK2 generation, bypassing the SGW often meant digging under the dashboard to find the SGW module itself and unplugging it to insert a "12+8" bypass cable. The WL platform simplifies access to the network core but moves the physical location, causing significant confusion.
The Star Connector is a passive electrical hub where multiple CAN bus lines converge. It is effectively a physical "router" for the vehicle's network. Connecting here places the tool directly on the CAN-C or CAN-IHS bus.
Location and Access
Unlike the WK2 or Dodge Durango where the Star Connector might be found on the driver's side or behind the radio, the WL Grand Cherokee places its primary Star Connector bank in the passenger side footwell.3
* Access Procedure: The technician must remove the silence panel (kick plate) under the passenger glovebox. This is typically held in place by two or three push-pins.
* Identification: Look for a bank of connectors, often white or green, with multiple two-wire twisted pairs entering them. These are the CAN lines.
* Connection Strategy: A dedicated "Star Connector Cable" (such as the ADC-2011 for Smart Pro or the Autel Chrysler 12+8/Star adapter) is required. This cable features a male probe that plugs into any empty slot on the Star Connector bank. If no empty slots exist, a "Y" splitter cable can be used to interrupt and bridge an existing connection.5


  



The distinction between using a "12+8 Cable" (at the SGW) and a "Star Connector Cable" (at the Star block) is critical. While both achieve a bypass, the 12+8 cable requires locating the SGW module, which can be buried deep in the dash on the WL. The Star Connector in the footwell is significantly more accessible and provides the same level of bus access.5
3. The Radio Frequency Hub Module (RFHM)
The RFHM is the brain of the passive entry and immobilizer system. It receives signals from the remote keyless entry (RKE) fob and the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS). On the WL platform, the RFHM has undergone a significant security hardening process compared to the WK2.
3.1 Architecture and "Locking" Mechanism
The WL RFHM utilizes a secure microcontroller (often Renesas or NEC based) with an encrypted bootloader.
* The "Lock" State: If the RFHM detects malformed data packets or a sequence of PIN entry attempts that resembles a brute-force attack, it enters a "Lock" state. In previous generations, this was a simple timer (e.g., "Wait 15 minutes").
* The "Brick" State: On the WL, aggressive probing by aftermarket tools via OBD—specifically utilizing algorithms designed for older firmware—can corrupt the bootloader itself. The module does not just lock; it effectively erases its own operational software or corrupts the checksum. When this happens, the vehicle displays the message "Service Passive Entry" on the cluster. The ignition will not cycle off, and the vehicle will not start.1
3.2 Part Number Variance
Technicians must be aware of RFHM part number revisions. Modules with part numbers ending in "AM" or higher are known to have the latest, most aggressive security patches. These modules are almost impervious to current OBD-based PIN reading exploits and have the highest failure rate when subjected to them.6


  



3.3 Bench Programming: A Limited Option
Given the risks of OBD programming, "Bench" programming (removing the module and connecting directly to the chip) is a theoretical alternative.
* The Problem: Unlike the WK2 RF Hub, which has widespread support for ePROM reading via tools like the Yanhua Mini ACDP or VVDI Prog, the WL RF Hub's circuit board layout and MCU type are different.
* Current Support: As of early 2026, solder-free bench adapters (like the ACDP interface boards) for the WL-specific RF Hub are not widely available or validated. Most available adapters (e.g., ACDP Module 29) are designed for Audi BCM2 or older Chrysler RF Hubs.7
* Conclusion: Bench programming is currently not a viable standard workflow for the WL platform for most locksmiths. It is primarily a data recovery method used by specialized ECU repair facilities.
4. PIN Code Acquisition Protocols
The PIN code is the cryptographic key required to authorize any new fob. The method of obtaining this PIN is the single most decisive factor in the success or failure of the job.
4.1 Decision Protocol: The Safety Matrix
The following analysis defines the operational logic for determining the programming path.
Scenario
	PIN Status
	Risk Level
	Recommended Action
	Scenario A
	PIN Unknown
	Critical (High)
	Do NOT attempt OBD Read. Purchase PIN via Broker or retrieve via NASTF.
	Scenario B
	PIN Known
	Low
	Safe to proceed with Aftermarket Tool (Autel/Smart Pro) or WiTech.
	Scenario C
	"Bricked" Unit
	Fatal
	Module replacement required. Tow to dealer or replace RF Hub.
	4.2 The "Dealer-Only" Reality of PINs
While the user's query asks if the car is "Dealer-Only," the nuance is that the data is Dealer-Only, even if the labor is not.
* OBD Reading: Tools like the Autel IM508/IM608, OBDSTAR Key Master, and AutoProPad often list a "Read PIN" function for the 2021+ Grand Cherokee. Do not use this function. The failure rate is unacceptably high.1 The tool attempts to exploit a vulnerability that the new "AM" firmware patches, leading to a bootloader corruption.
* The Safe Path: The only professionally responsible method is to obtain the 4-digit PIN code from a source external to the vehicle.
   * NASTF: Registered VSPs can access the PIN via the TechAuthority portal.
   * Brokers: Third-party services can calculate the PIN from the VIN for a fee ($15-$60). This removes all interaction with the RF Hub's delicate security sectors until the actual programming step.9
5. Tool Selection and Capabilities
The market is flooded with tools claiming coverage. This section analyzes their actual performance on the WL platform.
5.1 OEM Tool: WiTech 2.0 (The Gold Standard)
* Requirement: Requires a J2534 Pass-Through device (e.g., CardAQ Plus 3), a laptop, and a specialized subscription to TechAuthority and WiTech 2.0 Cloud.10
* Capabilities: 100% success rate for programming (assuming the module is not already bricked). It is the only tool capable of reviving a "soft-bricked" module by performing a "Restore Vehicle Configuration" or firmware flash.
* Pros: Safe, official, reliable.
* Cons: Expensive recurring subscriptions; difficult for mobile locksmiths to maintain active login credentials in the field.
5.2 Autel IM608 Pro II / IM508S
* Status: The industry workhorse.
* Coverage: Supports "Add Key" and "All Keys Lost" for WL 2021-2025.11
* Constraint: The user must manually input the PIN. The "Auto Scan" or "Read PIN" functions are the danger points. When the tool asks "Do you have the PIN?", the technician must select YES.
* Universal Keys: Autel's "IKEY" universal remotes can be generated for the WL platform (FCC M3NWXF0B1), but OEM keys are preferred for long-term reliability.13
5.3 OBDSTAR / Key Tool Max
* Status: Supports the platform but shares the same risks as Autel regarding PIN reading.
* Updates: OBDSTAR has been aggressive with updates (e.g., V40.38) adding support for 2022+ models, but the fundamental hardware risk of the RF Hub remains.14
6. Comprehensive Procedures
6.1 Prerequisites and Environmental Control
Before connecting any tool, the environment must be stabilized. The WL platform is extremely sensitive to voltage fluctuations, specifically regarding the interaction between the RF Hub and the Air Suspension Control Module (ASCM).
* Voltage Support: A proper battery maintainer (e.g., Midtronics or similar) capable of sustaining 13.5V at 30A is mandatory. A simple jump pack is insufficient.
* Air Suspension Isolation:
   * Why? When the ignition is cycled, the air suspension compressor may activate to level the vehicle. This causes a massive current spike and bus noise that can interrupt the key programming handshake.15
   * Procedure: Locate the under-hood fuse box. Remove Fuse F05 (Compressor) and Fuses F50/F87 (Suspension Module).16 Reinstall only after the job is complete and the vehicle is asleep.
6.2 Procedure A: "Add Key" / "All Keys Lost" (Safe Aftermarket Method)
This procedure assumes the technician has the PIN code in hand.
1. Preparation:
   * Ensure all doors are closed.
   * Connect battery maintainer.
   * SGW Bypass: Remove the passenger footwell silence panel. Connect the Star Connector Cable (e.g., Autel ADC-2011) to an open port on the Star Connector bank. Connect the VCI to this cable.
2. Tool Setup (Autel Example):
   * Select IMMO > Jeep > Grand Cherokee > 2021-2025 (WL).
   * Note: Ensure you select "WL" and not "WK" or "L" (unless it is the L model), although the systems are nearly identical on the new platform.
   * Select Control Unit > RFHM > Immobilizer (CAN).
3. Authentication:
   * Select Key Learning.
   * The tool will prompt: "Please switch ignition OFF and turn on Hazard lights."
   * The tool will ask: "Do you have the PIN?" Select YES.
   * Enter the 4-digit PIN code.
4. Learning:
   * The tool will prompt to place the new smart key against the Start/Stop button. (Note: The antenna ring is located directly around the button, not in the cup holder as in some other models).17
   * Press the "Unlock" button on the fob when prompted.
   * Watch the instrument cluster. A chime typically indicates success, and the key count will increment.
5. Verification:
   * Exit the software. Disconnect the VCI.
   * Test Lock/Unlock.
   * Test Remote Start.
   * Test Proximity Entry (Walk up and grab handle).
6.3 Procedure B: Recovery from "Service Passive Entry"
If a technician attempts an OBD read and triggers the "Service Passive Entry" message, the vehicle is in a "Soft Brick" state.
1. Hard Reset:
   * Disconnect the negative battery terminal (located under the driver's seat, accessible by sliding the seat forward and removing the battery cover).18
   * Touch the negative cable end to the positive cable end (capacitive discharge) or leave disconnected for 30 minutes.
2. Revival Attempt:
   * Reconnect the battery.
   * Attempt to cycle the ignition using the original working key (if available) by pressing the fob nose into the button.
   * If the message clears, you are lucky. Proceed to Procedure A using a purchased PIN.
   * If the message persists and the vehicle performs no action, the RF Hub is permanently corrupted.
7. Troubleshooting and Failure Analysis
7.1 "Key Fob Not Detected" (Non-Critical)
If the vehicle displays "Key Fob Not Detected" but is not displaying "Service Passive Entry," the issue is likely environmental or mechanical.
* RF Hub Lockout: Too many failed PIN entries will lock the module for 1 hour. Leave the ignition in the "Run" position (if possible) or simply wait with the battery connected.
* Antenna Disconnect: If the vehicle has had bodywork or the headliner was dropped, check the coaxial antenna connections on the RF Hub.19
* Fob Battery: Ensure the new key has a fresh CR2450 or CR2032 battery. Aftermarket keys often ship with cheap "test" batteries.
7.2 Emergency Start Procedures
The WL platform relies on a backup transponder coil for emergency starting when the fob battery is dead.
* Location: The coil is located behind the Start/Stop button itself.
* Procedure: Press the "nose" (the end opposite the key ring) of the fob directly into the button to push it. This proximity allows the inductive coil to energize the transponder chip inside the fob.17
7.3 Proximity Sensor Issues (Passive Entry)
Reports of "Service Passive Entry" can also be caused by handle sensor failures, unrelated to programming.
* Diagnosis: If the error appears spontaneously (not during programming), it is often a corroded connector in the door handle or a failed passive entry antenna.
* Programming Link: If this error appears during programming, it is almost certainly the RF Hub bootloader corruption described in Section 3.1.
8. Requirements Checklist & Conclusion
To satisfy the specific constraints of the user's request:
* Does WL use SGW? Yes. It is present, but the primary barrier is now the RF Hub's bootloader security. The SGW must be bypassed via the Star Connector (Passenger Footwell) for reliable programming.
* AKL Procedure: The immobilizer is controlled by the RFHM. The procedure is OBD-based programming utilizing a pre-purchased PIN. Bench programming is effectively non-existent for the average locksmith due to a lack of reliable adapters. ACDP support is minimal/unverified for the WL-specific module.
* Add Key Procedure: Aftermarket tools (Autel/OBDSTAR) work, provided the PIN is obtained externally. WiTech is not strictly required for "Add Key" but is the only safety net for recovery.
* PIN: 4-digits. Obtain via NASTF (TechAuthority) or third-party VIN-to-PIN broker. Do not read via OBD.
* Complications: Air Suspension requires pulling fuses F05/F50/F87 to prevent voltage spikes. Proximity sensors generally do not interfere with programming, but a "Service Passive Entry" error is the hallmark of a bricked RF Hub.
* Dealer Only? No, but it requires "Dealer-Level" preparation (buying the PIN). It is not a "plug-and-play" job for a novice with a basic tool.
The 2021-2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee WL represents a maturation of automotive security. The "Wild West" days of brute-forcing PIN codes are over for this platform. Success requires a disciplined adherence to protocol: isolate the electrical system, bypass the gateway physically, and treat the PIN code as a key that must be acquired before the tool ever touches the car. Failure to respect the RF Hub's vulnerability will result in a tow truck, a dealer visit, and a significant financial loss.

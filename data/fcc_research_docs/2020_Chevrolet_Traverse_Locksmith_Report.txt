Clearance: Public / Trade Release
1. Executive Intelligence Summary
The 2020 Chevrolet Traverse represents a pivotal intersection in General Motors' automotive security evolution, occupying a unique and often misunderstood position within the locksmithing landscape. Situated on the C1XX platform, this vehicle operates in the technological twilight zone between the long-established Global A electronic architecture and the emerging, highly encrypted Global B—also known as the Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP)—architecture. For the automotive locksmith, this specific model year poses a unique set of challenges that differ significantly from its predecessors on the Lambda platform (2009–2017) and its successors in the full Global B era (2024+).
This report serves as an exhaustive operational dossier, designed not merely as a procedural guide but as a forensic analysis of the vehicle’s security logic. We will dismantle the operational requirements for programming, analyze the risks of catastrophic module failure—colloquially known as "bricking"—and provide a verified database of FCC IDs, transponder protocols, and cross-platform compatibilities. The analysis indicates that while the 2020 Traverse is technically a late-stage Global A vehicle, its adoption of CAN FD (Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate) communication protocols creates a hardware barrier for older diagnostic tools. Furthermore, the reliance on the Body Control Module (BCM) as the central cryptographic gatekeeper introduces severe risks related to voltage stability during programming. Failure to maintain precise voltage levels can result in BCM data corruption, a condition that is often irreversible without dealer-level intervention or invasive EEPROM work.
The operational readiness status for this vehicle is classified as Moderate to High Risk due to these voltage sensitivities. The key system is a high-frequency Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS) proximity system, completely eliminating the bladed ignition of previous generations. Successful servicing requires not only specialized knowledge of the "hybrid" architecture but also specific hardware, such as CAN FD adapters and strictly regulated external power supplies. This report will guide the professional through every stage of the engagement, from architectural identification to the final verification of remote functionality.
2. Electronic Architecture & Immobilizer Topology
To master the programming of the 2020 Traverse, one must first dismantle and understand the underlying electronic terrain. The vehicle operates on GM’s C1XX platform, a crossover-specific chassis that integrates complex module communication networks. The distinction between "Global A" and "Global B" is the single most critical piece of intelligence for the locksmith, as it dictates tool choice, programming pathways, and the risk of immutable lockouts.
2.1 The Global A vs. Global B Conundrum
A primary source of confusion in the locksmith community regarding 2020–2023 GM vehicles is the architecture classification. General Motors has been in a multi-year transition phase, moving from the open and modular Global A architecture to the locked-down Global B platform. Understanding where the 2020 Traverse falls on this spectrum is a prerequisite for successful interaction with the vehicle's immobilizer system.
Global A was the standard for most GM vehicles from approximately 2010 to 2019. It allowed for relatively straightforward modular swapping and programming via J2534 interfaces or aftermarket tools. In contrast, the Global B architecture, introduced selectively starting in 2020 with high-profile models like the Corvette C8 and Cadillac CT5, features encrypted ECU communication.1 This new architecture, also known as the Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP), creates a digital wall that blocks most aftermarket tools from "writing" to the car without a live, authenticated handshake with GM's central servers.
Forensic analysis of the 2020 Traverse confirms that it utilizes a Late-Stage Global A architecture, sometimes referred to within engineering circles as "Global A Enhanced." It does not possess the full localized encryption of Global B that completely walls off scanners like the Autel IM608 or SmartPro from accessing the BCM. However, it represents a significant evolutionary step by integrating CAN FD (Flexible Data-Rate) protocols on the diagnostic lines.3 This distinction is vital for the operator in the field. If the vehicle were full Global B, current aftermarket methods would largely fail without expensive dealer credentials and online access. Because it is late Global A with CAN FD, it remains programmable via aftermarket means, but it strictly requires tools that can communicate at the higher data rates inherent to the CAN FD standard.
The evolution of GM's electronic architecture can be understood as a timeline of increasing complexity and security. The "Legacy Era" prior to 2010 utilized simple CAN and Class 2 data lines. The "Global A Era" (2010–2019) introduced high-speed CAN and standardized modular programming. The 2020 Traverse sits in a specific transitionary window—the "CAN FD Adoption Phase"—where the physical layer of the network was upgraded to support faster data transmission for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), but the security layer had not yet fully implemented the impenetrable encryption of the "Global B / VIP Era" that would follow in 2023/2024.1 This positioning means the locksmith is working on a vehicle that speaks a modern, fast language (CAN FD) but still operates under the older, more permissive security rules of Global A.
2.2 The Body Control Module (BCM) Nexus
In the 2020 Traverse, the Body Control Module (BCM) serves as the operational commander of the security system. Unlike older systems where an Immobilizer Control Module (ICM) might have been a standalone entity mounted on the ignition barrel, the PEPS system in the C1XX platform is integrated directly into the BCM.6 The BCM is the repository for the vehicle's "Environment Identifier" (EID) and the cryptographic keys necessary to authenticate the remote fobs. It constantly communicates with the Remote Control Door Lock Receiver (RCDLR) to detect the physical proximity of the fob and authorize the engine start request.
The location of the BCM is a critical piece of knowledge for diagnostic troubleshooting and emergency recovery. It is generally located under the driver's side dashboard, positioned near the kick panel and the firewall.6 This placement makes it accessible, though not convenient, for direct access. While standard programming via the OBDII port does not require physical access to the module, scenarios involving "bricked" units or lost communication may require the locksmith to remove the BCM for bench programming or EEPROM work. The module acts as a high-traffic junction for the vehicle's primary wiring harnesses, meaning any physical manipulation must be done with extreme care to avoid damaging connector pins.
The BCM in this generation of GM vehicles is notoriously sensitive to voltage fluctuation. During the key "Learn" process, the BCM must rewrite critical sectors of its non-volatile memory to store the new key data. If the system voltage drops below a critical threshold—typically 12.0 volts—during this write cycle, the bootloader sequence can fail. This interruption leaves the BCM in an indeterminate state, often referred to as "bricked," where it will no longer communicate with the OBDII port or wake up the vehicle's bus network.9 This vulnerability highlights why the BCM is considered the single most critical point of failure in the 2020 Traverse's security architecture.
2.3 CAN Bus Topology and Gateway Architecture
The 2020 Traverse employs a Gateway architecture, a sophisticated network design that segregates the vehicle's various data buses to manage traffic and enhance security. The OBDII port does not connect directly to every module in the car. Instead, it connects to a Gateway—often integrated into the BCM or existing as a separate Gateway Module—which then routes traffic to the appropriate network, such as the High-Speed CAN, Low-Speed GMLAN, or the Chassis CAN.
For the locksmith, this topology has direct operational implications. When a programmer is plugged into the OBDII port, it is essentially sending a request to the Gateway to pass a message to the Immobilizer system residing within the BCM. If the Gateway is overwhelmed by traffic—caused, for instance, by aftermarket alarms, poorly installed GPS trackers, or low system voltage—the programming messages may be dropped or delayed. This can result in communication failures that appear to be tool errors but are actually network congestion issues. Furthermore, the use of CAN FD allows for much larger data payloads (up to 64 bytes compared to the classic 8 bytes), meaning the Gateway expects data to arrive at specific speeds and formats. Using a tool that does not support CAN FD is akin to trying to speak slowly to a person who is listening for a fast-forwarded message; the handshake simply never occurs.
3. Critical Operational Alerts (The "Red Zone")
Before initiating any interaction with a 2020 Chevrolet Traverse, the security professional must internalize a set of critical alerts. These are not mere suggestions; they are mandatory safeguards designed to prevent liability and catastrophic vehicle damage. The margin for error on the C1XX platform is significantly narrower than on older GM trucks or sedans.
3.1 The Battery Voltage Imperative
The most critical alert for the 2020 Traverse concerns the vehicle's power supply during programming. The severity of this issue cannot be overstated; GM Technical Service Bulletins (TSB 23-NA, 22-NA) specifically highlight the risk of control module damage due to voltage instability.10
The programming procedure for the Traverse is lengthy. While the "Add Key" loop can be relatively fast, an "All Keys Lost" procedure mandates a security wait time of at least 30 minutes, consisting of three consecutive 10-minute cycles.12 During this entire duration, the vehicle's ignition is typically in the "ON" position (engine off), a state that energizes the infotainment screen, HVAC blowers, daylight running lights, and multiple Electronic Control Units (ECUs).
The physics of failure in this scenario are straightforward. A standard lead-acid car battery typically possesses 40 to 60 amp-hours of capacity. A modern SUV like the Traverse, when in "Key On, Engine Off" mode, can draw anywhere from 20 to 30 amps to power its various systems. Within 20 minutes, a marginal or even a standard battery will see its voltage drop below 11.5 volts. The BCM's internal logic often inhibits memory writing if the voltage is detected below 12.0V. Even more dangerous is a voltage sag during the write process. If the voltage dips while the BCM is saving the new key data, the checksum calculation will fail, and the data packet will be corrupted. This corruption creates a "brick" scenario.
Therefore, the mandate for the locksmith is absolute: You MUST connect a clean, stabilized power supply to the vehicle before beginning. This does not mean a simple jump pack, which provides a burst of amperage but does not regulate voltage over time. The requirement is for a voltage maintainer or stabilizer capable of holding a steady 13.0V to 13.8V for the entire duration of the process. Relying on the vehicle's internal battery is a gamble with odds that favor expensive repairs.
3.2 The "Sleep Mode" Trap
GM vehicles are engineered with aggressive power-saving protocols. If the driver’s door is left open for an extended period, the BCM may initiate a sleep mode to preserve the battery. Conversely, during the long 10-minute wait cycles of the "All Keys Lost" procedure, the vehicle may attempt to enter a low-power state, cutting communication with the diagnostic scanner.
To mitigate this, the standard operating procedure involves keeping the driver’s door closed to prevent the "door ajar" signal from keeping the BCM awake unnecessarily, while simultaneously keeping the window rolled down to prevent an accidental lockout. To ensure the CAN bus remains active during the wait times, some locksmiths recommend actuating the brake pedal or flashing the high beams once every few minutes. However, most modern high-quality diagnostic tools are programmed to send "keep-alive" messages to the Gateway to prevent sleep mode during critical operations.
3.3 Known Failure Points & "Gotchas"
Beyond the battery issue, the field is littered with other potential failure points that the astute technician must avoid.
Aftermarket LED Interference: A surprisingly common issue involves aftermarket LED headlights or interior bulbs. These components, often imported and lacking proper RF shielding, can emit radio frequency noise that interferes with the 433 MHz transponder signal. During the "pocket" learning phase, the vehicle attempts to communicate with the low-power chip in the key fob. If the RF environment is polluted by noisy LEDs, the BCM may fail to detect the key, leading to a "No Remote Detected" error.
GPS Trackers and OBD Splitters: Many vehicles, particularly those sold by "Buy-Here-Pay-Here" dealerships, are equipped with GPS tracking devices. these devices are often plugged into the OBDII port using a Y-cable splitter tucked up under the dashboard. These splitters can degrade the signal quality of the diagnostic lines or interrupt the specialized CAN FD communication required for programming. It is standard practice to inspect the OBD port wiring under the dash for any unauthorized devices and disconnect them before attempting to program keys.
The "Remote Learn Pending" Loop: A documented glitch in the Traverse's firmware is the "Remote Learn Pending" loop. During the On-Board Programming procedure, the Driver Information Center (DIC) may get stuck displaying this message and refuse to advance to the next step. This state usually indicates a software hang within the BCM. The resolution typically requires a "hard reset"—disconnecting the battery for 15 minutes to force the modules to reboot.12 However, this should only be attempted if the programming cycle has completely failed or finished, as cutting power during a write cycle brings us back to the risk of bricking the module.
Battery Disconnect Issues: Disconnecting the battery to solve one problem can sometimes create others. On the 2020 Traverse, a battery disconnect may reset the window indexing (requiring the user to roll the window down and up to relearn the stops) and can occasionally trigger the anti-theft system to enter a "lockdown" mode, requiring a basic security relearn procedure. Locksmiths should be prepared to perform these minor relearn procedures as part of the service if a battery reset becomes necessary.7
4. Immobilizer System Intelligence
This section details the specific hardware and data profiles for the 2020 Traverse, providing the forensic data necessary for part identification and compatibility verification.
4.1 FCC ID & Remote Specifications
The 2020 Traverse uses a high-security proximity key system. Precision in selecting the correct key fob is non-negotiable. Unlike older GM keys where different FCC IDs might cross-program if the frequency matched, modern PEPS systems are intolerant of mismatches in data protocols or button configurations.
The primary FCC ID for the 2020 Chevrolet Traverse is HYQ4EA.16 This remote operates at a frequency of 433 MHz (often listed as 434 MHz in some databases; these refer to the same functional band). The OEM part numbers associated with this ID include 13529636, 13519177, and 13591384. The key blade utilizes the HU100 high-security milled track (laser cut) profile, which is standard for most modern GM vehicles.19
Inside the fob, the transponder chip is a Philips ID46 (GM Extended) type, often identified on the circuit board by the IC number "1551A-4EA".18 The remote typically features a 5-button or 7-button configuration, including Lock, Unlock, Remote Start, Hatch Release, and Panic. A critical insight for inventory management is that the button configuration on the PCB must match the vehicle's trim level features for full functionality. For example, using a 5-button key on a High Country trim equipped with a rear glass release (requiring a 7-button remote) may result in the basic lock/unlock functions working, but the specific glass release feature being inaccessible. Conversely, using a higher-button remote on a lower-trim vehicle usually causes no issues, with the extra buttons simply remaining inactive.
It is imperative to distinguish the HYQ4EA remote from the visually similar HYQ1EA remote. The HYQ1EA is used on some GMC Acadia and Terrain models.21 Despite looking identical and operating on a similar frequency, the underlying cryptographic protocols are different. A HYQ1EA key will not program to a vehicle expecting a HYQ4EA key, leading to failed programming attempts that consume valuable token slots or time.


  



4.2 Cross-Platform Compatibility
Understanding the "siblings" of the Traverse on the C1XX platform allows for smarter inventory management and troubleshooting. The HYQ4EA key is not unique to the Traverse; it serves as a shared component across several large crossovers in the GM portfolio. The verified compatibility list includes:
* Chevrolet Traverse: 2018–2020
* Chevrolet Blazer: 2019–2020
* Buick Enclave: 2018–2020 22
This cross-compatibility means that a locksmith carrying the HYQ4EA remote can service a wide swath of the "soccer mom" SUV market with a single SKU. However, this compatibility does not extend indefinitely. The introduction of full Global B architecture in later years breaks this compatibility, necessitating different keys for 2021+ or 2023+ models depending on the specific rollout schedule of the VIP platform for each model.
4.3 The Cadillac XT6 Distinction (HYQ2ES vs HYQ4EA)
A common pitfall involves the Cadillac XT6. While the XT6 is mechanically a sibling to the Traverse, sharing the same chassis, engine options, and suspension components, the security hardware diverges significantly. Research indicates that the Cadillac XT6 utilizes a different key fob with FCC ID HYQ2ES.23
This distinction is crucial and highlights a broader trend in automotive security: platform sharing does not equal security sharing. The Cadillac BCM firmware operates on a different encryption protocol or potentially a slightly different frequency modulation optimized for the luxury marque's specific feature set. Locksmiths must avoid the assumption that "if it fits the ignition, it fits the system." Attempting to program a Chevy HYQ4EA key to a Cadillac XT6 will result in failure, as the BCM will simply refuse to acknowledge the foreign transponder signal.
5. Tooling & Procedure Analysis
With the architecture and hardware defined, we turn to the tools required to breach the system. The 2020 Traverse requires a modernized toolkit, specifically addressing the CAN FD requirement.
5.1 The CAN FD Adapter Requirement
The transition to CAN FD (Flexible Data-Rate) is the single most significant tooling hurdle for this model year. The evidence from Autel documentation is explicit: "2020+ GM Models" are listed as requiring the CAN FD adapter for successful communication.4
While legacy CAN protocols operated at speeds of 500 kbps, CAN FD allows for variable data rates that can exceed 5 Mbps with larger payload sizes. The 2020 Traverse BCM communicates diagnostic data over this high-speed protocol. While it is theoretically possible that some earlier 2020 production models might retain legacy CAN communication for basic functions, attempting to program keys without a CAN FD adapter is a gamble that no professional should take. If the BCM attempts to switch to high-speed communication during the handshake and the diagnostic tool cannot support the rate, the programming session will abort. This abortion is dangerous; it can leave the BCM in an open, unsecured state or corrupt the data being written.
The recommendation is absolute: Always use a CAN FD adapter (e.g., the Autel CAN FD Adapter) when connecting to a 2020 Traverse with an Autel IM608 or IM508. For users of the newer generation tools, such as the Autel IM608 Pro II (IM608 II), the CAN FD protocol is built directly into the VCI (Vehicle Communication Interface), negating the need for an external dongle.26
5.2 Tool-Specific Performance
The market offers several robust solutions for programming the Traverse, provided the CAN FD requirement is met.
Autel IM608 / IM508
The Autel ecosystem is a dominant player in this space. The IM608 and IM508 tablets are fully capable of performing both "Add Key" and "All Keys Lost" functions via the OBDII port.
* Procedure: The path is typically found under "Hot Function > All Smart Keys Lost (Guided)".27 The "Guided" function is particularly useful as it walks the user through the specific steps, including the necessary power cycling.
* Wait Time: The tool will enforce a 10-12 minute wait time. This is a security feature built into the GM BCM to prevent "smash and grab" theft. The tool cannot bypass this wait; it must simply wait for the timer to expire so the BCM unlocks the programming partition.
* Pin Code: The Autel system is generally successful at reading the 4-digit PIN code automatically from the BCM during the process.27 This eliminates the need for third-party PIN codes or NASTF credentials in most cases.
* XP400 Programmer: While the XP400 is a powerful EEPROM and key programmer, its primary role in an OBD engagement is minimal. It is used to verify the key data or to unlock "locked" keys, but the actual programming to the car is handled by the VCI and the tablet. The XP400 becomes critical only if the OBD method fails and the locksmith must resort to bench programming the BCM—a rare and advanced scenario.
Advanced Diagnostics SmartPro
The SmartPro is another industry standard, favored for its stability and specific software modules.
* Capability: Excellent support for the 2020 Traverse under the "Chevrolet Traverse 2020" selection.
* Procedure: Connects via the standard OBD cable (Smart Aerial may be required for pre-coding in some scenarios, though usually not for GM prox).
* Wait Time: Like the Autel, the SmartPro respects the 10-minute security bypass wait.28
* Pin Code: The SmartPro software attempts to pull the PIN automatically. If it fails, the user is prompted to enter it manually, which may require purchasing a code from a GM code broker or using a specialized PIN reading tool.


  



6. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
These procedures are synthesized from field reports and official manuals. They assume that the locksmith has already performed the critical pre-checks: verifying the battery voltage is stabilized above 13.0V and ensuring the correct key frequency and FCC ID are in hand.
6.1 The "Pocket" Location
Crucial for programming is the correct placement of the key. The BCM uses a low-frequency antenna to communicate with the key fob during the learning process. If the key is not in the exact "sweet spot," the procedure will fail.
* Location: Research identifies two potential locations: the Front Cupholder and the Center Console Storage Bin.
* Ambiguity Resolution: While some sources generalize, specific Chevrolet documentation typically points to the front cupholder for the Traverse.13 The locksmith should inspect the bottom of the front cupholder; removing the rubber mat often reveals a key-shaped indentation designed to align the fob with the antenna coil. If the cupholder yields no results, the secondary location is inside the center armrest console, often in a dedicated slot or pocket.27 The "cupholder" location is most common for Chevrolet, while the "console slot" is more typical of Cadillac, but the shared platform necessitates checking both.
6.2 SOP 1: Add Key (On-Board Programming - OBP)
This method is the preferred "low-impact" route. It requires two (2) currently working smart keys to be present. This procedure allows the vehicle to learn a third key without the need for a diagnostic tool, bypassing the risks associated with OBD communication and voltage drops.
1. Preparation: Place the two working keys in the front cupholder.29 Ensure the vehicle is off.
2. Mechanical Access: Locate the driver's door handle. Remove the plastic cap at the rear of the handle to expose the mechanical lock cylinder. This is done by inserting the key blade into the slot at the bottom of the cap and lifting upward/outward.
3. Initiation: Insert the new key's cut emergency blade into the door lock.
4. The "Magic" Cycle: Turn the key to the UNLOCK position five (5) times within 10 seconds. This specific cadence triggers the BCM to enter learn mode.
5. Confirmation: Watch the Driver Information Center (DIC) on the dashboard. It should light up and display "READY FOR REMOTE #3" (or the next available slot number).
6. Programming: Place the new smart key in the programming pocket (cupholder or console slot).
7. Finalize: Press the Engine Start/Stop button. The DIC should verify that the key has been learned.
8. Exit: To exit the programming mode, press and hold the Start/Stop button for approximately 12 seconds until the cluster display returns to normal.


  



6.3 SOP 2: All Keys Lost (AKL) / Add Key via Diagnostic Tool
This method is required when no working keys are available, or if the OBP method fails. It involves a deeper interaction with the BCM and carries higher risk.
1. Safety Check: Connect the voltage maintainer and verify a steady reading of 13.4V. Ensure the climate control, radio, and headlights are off to minimize load.
2. Hardware Connect: Plug the Autel VCI (or similar tool) equipped with the CAN FD adapter into the OBDII port.
3. Menu Navigation: Navigate to GM > Chevrolet > Traverse > 2020 > Smart Key system.
4. Function Selection: Select "All Keys Lost" (or "Add Key" if available and appropriate). Note that "All Keys Lost" typically wipes the existing key index, ensuring that lost or stolen keys can no longer start the car—a prudent security step.
5. Pin Code Read: Execute the "Read Pin Code" function. The tool will query the BCM. Record the 4-digit code (e.g., 6145) displayed on the screen.27
6. The Wait: The tool will now initiate the security bypass sequence. Wait 10–12 minutes. Do not disturb the connection, open doors, or touch buttons. This is the BCM verifying that no unauthorized entry is occurring.
7. Key Learning:
   * Once the wait is over, the tool will prompt you to place the key in the slot (cupholder/console).
   * Press the Start/Stop button as prompted. The system usually requires a single press to wake the bus, followed by a press-and-hold to register the key.
   * Monitor the DIC for the message "Ready for Remote".
8. Cycling: Once the first key is learned, remove it. If a second key is needed, insert it now and press the Start/Stop button again.
9. Closing: Follow the tool prompts to exit the session. Test all buttons (Lock, Unlock, Remote Start, Panic) on all keys to ensure the RCDLR has correctly registered the remote functions alongside the immobilizer chip.
7. Security Barriers & Troubleshooting
Even with perfect adherence to procedure, the 2020 Traverse can resist programming due to environmental or hardware variables.
7.1 "No Remote Detected" After Programming
A frustrating scenario occurs when the vehicle accepts the key (DIC says "Learned") but subsequently displays "No Remote Detected" when attempting to start the engine, and the remote buttons fail to operate the locks.
* Cause 1: Sleep Mode: Some aftermarket keys are shipped in a deep sleep mode to preserve battery life. They need to be "woken up" by pressing a specific button sequence (often Lock and Unlock simultaneously) before they will transmit.
* Cause 2: Wrong Frequency/ID: This is the most common cause. You may have used a 315 MHz key instead of 433 MHz, or an HYQ1EA key instead of the required HYQ4EA. The BCM's immobilizer coil (low frequency) was able to read the ID46 chip and add it to the immobilizer list, but the RCDLR (high frequency) cannot "hear" the remote commands because they are on the wrong band or protocol.30
* Cause 3: Dead Battery: Never assume a new key has a good battery. A voltage check of the CR2032 cell should be standard procedure. A cell reading below 3.0V is effectively dead for reliable PEPS operation.
7.2 The Bricked BCM (Recovery)
If the BCM "bricks"—defined as a loss of all communication and a "dead" vehicle state—immediate and calculated action is required.
1. Hard Reset: Disconnect the vehicle's negative battery terminal. Leave it disconnected for at least 15 minutes. While disconnected, touch the negative cable to the positive cable (capacitive discharge) to drain any residual voltage from the capacitors in the modules. This forces a cold boot of the BCM's processor.
2. Retry: Reconnect the battery and attempt to establish communication with the scanner.
3. SPS2 Programming: If the hard reset fails, the BCM's firmware is likely corrupted. The only reliable recovery is to use a GM MDI2 interface (or a high-quality J2534 passthrough) and a subscription to AC Delco TDS (Techline Connect). You must perform a "Replace and Reprogram" procedure using the Service Programming System (SPS2) to flash the BCM with the original factory calibration files. This restores the operating system of the module.2
7.3 BCM Replacement
If the BCM is physically damaged or unrecoverable via flashing, replacement is the final option.
* Hardware: Requires a virgin or remanufactured BCM. Used BCMs from salvage yards are problematic because the VIN is hard-coded into One-Time Programmable (OTP) memory sectors. While some advanced locksmiths with EEPROM skills can "virginize" a used BCM by manually rewriting the hex data on the chip 31, this is beyond the scope of standard field work.
* Programming: The new module must be programmed via SPS2. The process involves downloading the specific calibration for the VIN and performing a "Immobilizer Learn" to sync the new BCM with the ECM (Engine Control Module) and the keys.

9. Conclusion
The 2020 Chevrolet Traverse is a sophisticated machine that demands respect. It is not a "plug-and-play" job like the older key-turn ignitions of the Lambda platform. The convergence of high-security PEPS, the sensitivity of the BCM to voltage drops, and the strict requirement for CAN FD communication creates a "perfect storm" for the unprepared locksmith.
However, for the equipped professional, it represents a standard and profitable service opportunity. By adhering to the Voltage Mandate, ensuring the correct HYQ4EA inventory, and utilizing CAN FD adapters, the operational risk is minimized to near zero. The "Global B" fear mongering largely does not apply to this specific model year, provided the technician treats it as a high-speed, sensitive Global A vehicle rather than an impenetrable fortress.
Final Locksmith’s Checklist:
1. [ ] Verify Voltage Maintainer is connected (>13.0V).
2. [ ] Verify CAN FD Adapter is attached to the programmer.
3. [ ] Verify Key FCC ID is HYQ4EA.
4. [ ] Locate the programming slot (Cupholder).
5. [ ] Ensure all aftermarket accessories (LEDs, Chargers) are unplugged.
Proceed with confidence, but proceed with caution. The 2020 Traverse is a gatekeeper to the modern era of automotive security; mastering it is essential for the longevity of the locksmithing enterprise.

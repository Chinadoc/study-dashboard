Comprehensive Forensic Audit of Automotive RF Security Protocols: Batch 1 Analysis
1. Executive Summary
This report constitutes a deep-dive forensic audit of twelve specific FCC IDs identified as "Research Batch 1" within the locksmith inventory database. The primary objective is to rectify missing, erroneous, or incomplete vehicle compatibility data, transponder chip identification, and frequency specifications. The analysis was necessitated by preliminary metadata inconsistencies—specifically the misattribution of Subaru and BMW hardware to Nissan and Toyota, respectively—which posed significant risks to inventory integrity and field programming success rates.
The investigation reveals that the twelve FCC IDs represent a cross-section of pivotal moments in automotive security history, ranging from the early Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) systems of the early 2000s to modern high-security proximity systems utilizing 128-bit AES encryption. A major finding is the confirmation of the CWTWBU745 identifier as a Subaru-specific protocol operating on the 433 MHz band, utilizing a Texas Instruments 4D-62 transponder, rather than a Nissan component as initially categorized. Similarly, N5F-ID21A is positively identified as a BMW Front Electronic Module (FEM/BDC) component, operating at 434 MHz, fundamentally incompatible with the Toyota/Lexus ecosystem originally suggested.
Furthermore, this report documents the architectural shift in Honda/Acura security systems, transitioning from the legacy Omron (OUC) and Alps (MLB) architectures operating at 313.8 MHz to the modern Continental (KR5) architecture at 433 MHz. This shift is not merely a frequency change but represents a move to bidirectional "G-Chip" (Hitag 3/Pro) communication, necessitating different programming equipment and inventory strategies.
The data presented herein provides a granular, actionable roadmap for database rectification. It distinguishes between OEM-manufactured identifiers and aftermarket "universal" replacements (e.g., the 2AOKM prefix), ensuring that inventory descriptions accurately reflect the hardware's origin and capability.


  



2. Methodology and Validation Protocols
The verification process employed for this report adheres to a rigorous three-tier validation protocol designed to ensure absolute data integrity for critical locksmithing applications. In an industry where a single mismatched frequency or incorrect transponder chip can result in a failed programming session—costing time, money, and customer trust—precision is paramount.
2.1 Regulatory and Hardware Analysis
The first tier of validation involved a direct analysis of the FCC Regulatory Filings associated with each ID. The FCC ID is a unique alphanumeric code assigned by the Federal Communications Commission to certify that wireless devices meet specific standards. By decoding the prefix of each ID, we established the original Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the remote hardware.
* Prefix CWT: Associated with Calsonic Kansei (now Marelli), a primary supplier for Nissan and Subaru. This shared supplier relationship often leads to cross-manufacturer confusion in databases.
* Prefix KR5: Associated with Continental Automotive Systems. This prefix is ubiquitous in modern European and Asian vehicles utilizing high-security proximity systems.
* Prefix OUC: Associated with Omron Automotive Electronics, a legacy supplier for Honda, GM, and others, typically indicating older generation 315 MHz or 313.8 MHz systems.
* Prefix N5F: Associated with Huf Hülsbeck & Fürst or Marquardt, major German suppliers for BMW and GM.
2.2 OEM Part Number Cross-Referencing
The FCC ID alone is often insufficient for precise inventory management because a single FCC ID can be shared across multiple part numbers with different button configurations (e.g., 3-button vs. 4-button) or memory settings (Driver 1 vs. Driver 2). We mapped each FCC ID to its specific OEM part numbers (e.g., Honda 72147-TLA-A01) to confirm trim-level compatibility. This step is crucial for modern Honda keys where "Driver 1" and "Driver 2" fobs are electrically identical in RF transmission but digitally distinct in their data payload.1
2.3 Transponder Signal Synthesis
The final and most critical tier involved identifying the specific transponder logic. A remote may transmit the correct frequency to unlock doors (RKE function), but if the transponder chip (Immobilizer function) is incorrect, the vehicle will not start. We synthesized data to distinguish between:
* Philips ID 46 (PCF7936/7952/7961): The "Hitag 2" standard, common in 2006-2015 vehicles.
* Philips ID 47 (NCF2951): The "Hitag 3" or "Hitag Pro" standard, used in modern push-to-start systems.
* Texas Instruments 4D/G/H: The 40-bit and 80-bit encryption standards used by Toyota and Subaru.

3. The Honda and Acura Ecosystem: A Study in Evolution
The Honda and Acura FCC IDs within this research batch—KR5V2X-V44, KR5T21, MLBHLIK-1TA, OUCG8D-399H-A, and OUCG8D-440H-A—serve as a chronological map of the manufacturer's security architecture evolution. We can distinctly categorize these into three eras: The Omron Legacy Era, the Alps Transitional Era, and the Continental Modern Era.
3.1 The Continental Era (2016–Present): 433 MHz and High Security
The most significant shift in recent Honda history is represented by the KR5 series of FCC IDs. Prior to 2015/2016, the vast majority of Honda vehicles in the North American market operated on 313.8 MHz. With the introduction of the global platform vehicles (Civic X, CR-V Gen 5), Honda transitioned to 433.92 MHz (often listed as 433 MHz).
3.1.1 FCC ID: KR5V2X-V44 (Honda)
Hardware Architecture:
This identifier belongs to the Continental "Smart Key" platform. It utilizes the Philips ID 47 transponder protocol, specifically the NCF295x family of chips, often marketed as "Hitag 3" or Honda's proprietary bidirectional "G" chip (not to be confused with Toyota's G-chip). This system utilizes 128-bit AES encryption, making it significantly more secure—and difficult to clone—than previous generations.
Compatibility and Nuance: The KR5V2X-V44 is the standard proximity key for the Honda CR-V (2017-2022), Honda Civic (2017-2021), and Honda Pilot (2016-2022).1 A critical inventory management detail is the existence of memory-specific fobs.
* Driver 1: OEM Part Number 72147-TLA-A11 (CR-V) or 72147-TG7-A11 (Pilot).
* Driver 2: OEM Part Number 72147-TLA-A21 (CR-V) or 72147-TG7-A21 (Pilot).
While both fobs carry the KR5V2X-V44 FCC ID and transmit on the same frequency, the BCM (Body Control Module) distinguishes them to recall specific seat, mirror, and climate settings. Programming a "Driver 2" fob to a slot expecting "Driver 1" (or vice versa) can lead to successful immobilization programming but a failure in remote memory recall functions. Locksmiths must stock both variants or utilize programmable universal keys that allow for memory slot selection.
Operational Note: The suffix -V44 is crucial. The base ID KR5V2X has multiple variants. V44 specifically supports the 5-button configuration (Lock, Unlock, Hatch, Remote Start, Panic) common on EX-L and Touring trims.
3.1.2 FCC ID: KR5T21 (Acura)
Hardware Architecture:
KR5T21 is the Acura-specific counterpart to the Honda KR5 system. While it shares the underlying Continental 433 MHz architecture and Philips ID 47 transponder logic, the communication protocol includes Acura-specific data packets related to the "Jewel Eye" lighting system and "Walk-Away Auto Lock" features.
Compatibility: This ID is exclusive to the Acura RDX (2019-2021) and Acura TLX (2021-2023).4 It is strictly a Proximity Smart Key.
* Part Numbers: 72147-TJB-A01 (Driver 1) and 72147-TJB-A11 (Driver 2) are the primary identifiers.
* Interchangeability: Unlike older generations where Honda and Acura keys might cross-program, the KR5T21 will generally not program to a Honda vehicle requiring KR5V2X, despite the hardware similarities, due to brand-byte filtering in the immobilizer handshake.
3.2 The Alps Transitional Era (2007–2015): Integrated Remote Head Keys
The mid-2000s saw Honda move away from separate fobs toward the "Integrated Remote Head Key" (RHK), where the remote buttons are built into the plastic head of the key blade.
3.2.1 FCC ID: MLBHLIK-1TA (Honda)
Hardware Architecture:
Manufactured by Alps Electric, this unit operates at 313.8 MHz. It marks the widespread adoption of the Philips ID 46 (PCF7961) transponder, where the immobilizer chip is integrated directly onto the remote's printed circuit board (PCB) rather than being a separate ceramic wedge (transponder) embedded in the plastic shell. This integration meant that if the remote battery died or the PCB was damaged, the car might still start (via induction), but the structural integrity of the electronics was paramount.
Compatibility: This is one of the most common Honda keys in circulation, covering the Honda CR-V (2007-2013), Honda Fit (2009-2013), Honda Insight (2010-2014), Honda CR-Z (2011-2015), and Honda Accord Crosstour (2010-2011).7
* Suffix Analysis: The -1TA suffix indicates a revision of the earlier MLBHLIK-1T. In practical locksmithing terms, 1TA keys are generally backward compatible with vehicles that came with 1T keys, but 1T keys may fail on newer vehicles designed for 1TA due to subtle changes in the rolling code algorithm window.
* Key Blade: This era utilizes the "High Security" (Laser Cut) HO01/HO03 keyway, which requires a side-mill duplicator, a significant shift from the standard double-sided edge cut keys of the early 2000s.
3.3 The Omron Legacy Era (2000–2010): The Frequency Split
The identifiers OUCG8D-399H-A and OUCG8D-440H-A highlight a critical period of fragmentation in the Honda Odyssey platform.
3.3.1 FCC ID: OUCG8D-440H-A (2001-2004)
Hardware Architecture: This remote operates at 308 MHz.10 This frequency is an outlier in the modern automotive spectrum and is specific to the 2nd Generation Odyssey.
* Transponder: For these model years, the immobilizer system (if equipped) utilized a Megamos 13 or Megamos 48 chip that was physically separate from the remote. The remote OUCG8D-440H-A itself is often a non-transponder device; it purely handles the Remote Keyless Entry (doors/sliding doors). The ignition key handles the security. This distinction is vital: replacing the remote does not fix a "no start" condition.
3.3.2 FCC ID: OUCG8D-399H-A (2005-2010)
Hardware Architecture: With the 3rd Generation Odyssey, Honda standardized to 313.8 MHz.13
* Transponder: This era introduced the Philips ID 46 chip. Depending on the trim (Touring vs. LX), this could be a separate fob or an integrated key. However, the FCC ID OUCG8D-399H-A is almost exclusively associated with the 5-button fob (Lock, Unlock, Left Door, Right Door, Panic) for the EX and Touring models.
* Compatibility: Compatible with Honda Odyssey (2005-2010).

4. The Nissan and Subaru Ecosystem: Deciphering the Calsonic Confusion
A major source of error in automotive databases stems from the shared supplier Calsonic Kansei (now Marelli), which provides remote entry systems for both Nissan and Subaru. The shared FCC ID prefix CWT often leads to misidentification. This section rectifies the data for CWTWBU745 and clarifies the complex landscape of CWTWB1U815.
4.1 FCC ID: CWTWBU745 (Subaru - Correction)
Forensic Correction: The initial research query metadata incorrectly attributed this ID to Nissan. Our analysis confirms that CWTWBU745 (and its variant CWTWB1U745) is exclusive to the Subaru ecosystem.16
Hardware Architecture:
This remote operates at 433 MHz. This is a significant deviation for the US market in the 2006-2008 era, where most Subaru vehicles (Impreza, Forester) were still on 315 MHz. The use of 433 MHz was specific to the Subaru Tribeca (2006-2008) and the Subaru Legacy/Outback (2006-2008).
* Transponder: The key utilizes a Texas Instruments 4D-62 transponder. This is an 80-bit encrypted chip. Unlike the common 4D-60 or 4D-67 used in Toyotas of the same era, the 4D-62 has a specific manufacturer signature required by the Subaru BIU (Body Integrated Unit).
* Inventory Alert: Because this key looks identical to other Subaru Remote Head Keys (which utilize 315 MHz), it is frequently mis-stocked. The visual identifier is the FCC ID stamped on the back. Failure to verify the ID will result in a remote that programs to the immobilizer (starts the car) but fails to program the remote functions (locks/unlocks), leaving the job incomplete.
4.2 FCC ID: CWTWB1U815 (Nissan)
Hardware Architecture:
This is a standard Nissan "Intelligent Key" (Proximity Fob) operating at 315 MHz. It utilizes the Philips ID 46 (PCF7952) transponder standard.
Compatibility and the 2013 Split: The primary application is the Nissan Sentra (2013-2016) and Nissan Versa/Versa Note (2013-2016).19
* Critical Split: The 2013 model year for the Nissan Sentra presents a notorious trap for locksmiths. There was a mid-year production change.
   * Early Production (Pre-May 2013): Typically uses CWTWB1U815.
   * Late Production (Post-May 2013): Often transitioned to CWTWB1U840.
   * Interchangeability: These fobs are not reliably interchangeable. While they look identical (same teardrop shape, 4 buttons), the internal board layout and antenna gain differ. Attempting to program a U840 to a U815 vehicle will often result in the car failing to detect the key in the programming slot. VIN verification or checking the original key's ID is mandatory before attempting service.
4.3 FCC ID: KBRASTU10 (Nissan)
Hardware Architecture:
This identifier represents the older RKE generation, operating at 315 MHz.
* Transponder: None. This remote is strictly for keyless entry. The vehicles it serves—Nissan Pathfinder (2000-2001), Xterra (2001), Frontier (2001), and Maxima (2001)—typically utilize a separate mechanical key.
* Security Context: While some 2000-2001 Nissans had NATS (Nissan Anti-Theft System) with a chip in the key head, the KBRASTU10 fob itself has no immobilizer component. Locksmiths should not attempt to "clone" this remote for starting capability.

5. Toyota and Aftermarket Dynamics: Encryption and Universals
5.1 FCC ID: MOZB52TH (Toyota/Scion)
Hardware Architecture:
This is a Remote Head Key operating at 314.3 MHz (often simplified to 314 or 315 MHz).
* Transponder: This key marks the "G-Chip" era (Texas Instruments 4D-72). The blade of the key is stamped with the letter "G".
* Evolution: Toyota's security evolved from the "Dot" chip (4D-67) to the "G" chip (4D-72) to the "H" chip (128-bit). MOZB52TH is strictly a G-chip key. It is not backward compatible with Dot-chip vehicles and not forward compatible with H-chip vehicles.
Compatibility: Primary applications include the Scion tC (2013-2016), Scion iQ (2014-2015), and Toyota Yaris (2014-2016).21 The inclusion of Scion models is significant, as the brand was discontinued, but the hardware lives on in the Toyota ecosystem.
5.2 FCC ID: 2AOKM-TY6 (Aftermarket Universal)
Identification: The prefix 2AOKM belongs to Keyless2Go, a prominent aftermarket manufacturer.24 This is not an OEM Toyota part.
* Function: This key is designed as a universal replacement for the OEM ID M0ZB21TG used in the Toyota Prius (2004-2009).
* Technical Context: The 2004-2009 Prius utilized a unique "Slot Key" architecture. The non-smart entry keys (Black Logo) utilized a specific transponder logic different from the Smart Entry (Silver Logo) keys. The 2AOKM-TY6 specifically targets the Non-Smart (Black Logo) application.
* Database Strategy: It is vital to label this as "Aftermarket" in the database. While fully functional, selling this as an "OEM Refurbished" part would be inaccurate and potentially violate consumer protection standards. It operates at 312 MHz, mimicking the OEM signal.
________________
6. European Architectures in the US Market
6.1 FCC ID: N5F-ID21A (BMW - Correction)
Forensic Correction: The initial query metadata incorrectly labeled this ID as "Toyota/Lexus". Our audit confirms this is a BMW component manufactured by Huf/Marquardt.25
Hardware Architecture:
This Smart Key operates at 434 MHz (specifically 433.92 MHz) and utilizes the PCF7953 (Hitag Pro) transponder.
* System: This fob is designed for the BMW FEM (Front Electronic Module) and BDC (Body Domain Controller) platforms. This architecture replaced the older CAS (Car Access System) modules.
* Compatibility: It serves the BMW X5 (F15 chassis, 2014-2016), BMW X6 (F16 chassis, 2014-2016), and early G-series models like the 5-Series (G30, 2018).
* Programming Complexity: Unlike older BMW keys which could sometimes be programmed via OBD2 with simple tools, FEM/BDC keys often require removing the module from the vehicle and reading the EEPROM data on a bench to generate a dealer key. Misidentifying this key as a Toyota key would lead to complete confusion at the programming stage.
6.2 FCC ID: N5F250738 (Saturn)
Hardware Architecture:
This is a General Motors RKE fob operating at 315 MHz.
* Compatibility: Saturn Ion (2003-2007).28
* Part History: This part (P/N 10357131) is the updated version of the older N5F736566-A. GM frequently superseded part numbers during this era.
* Immobilizer: The Saturn Ion used the Passlock system (specifically PK3+ in later years or basic Passlock resistance in earlier ones). The remote does not contain the chip; the security is in the key blade or ignition cylinder sensing.

	8. Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations
The forensic audit of Research Batch 1 highlights the critical importance of validating metadata beyond the "Known Info" provided in general locksmith queries. The rectification of the Subaru (CWTWBU745) and BMW (N5F-ID21A) identifiers is the most immediate value-add of this report, preventing potential database corruption and field service failures.
For the locksmith team, the following strategic actions are recommended:
1. Mandatory ID Checks: Implement a mandatory check of FCC IDs for all Subaru Legacy/Tribeca vehicles from 2006-2008 to distinguish between the 433 MHz (CWTWBU745) and 315 MHz systems.
2. Stock "Driver 2" Inventory: For the Honda KR5 series, ensure inventory depth for both Driver 1 and Driver 2 fobs, as they are not interchangeable for memory functions.
3. Label Aftermarket Parts: Clearly demarcate 2AOKM IDs as aftermarket solutions in the POS system to manage customer expectations regarding logo presence and build quality.
This detailed analysis confirms the compatibility data for the requested IDs and provides the necessary technical context to support high-confidence programming in the field.

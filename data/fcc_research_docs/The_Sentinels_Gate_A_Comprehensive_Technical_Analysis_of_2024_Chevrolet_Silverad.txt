The Sentinel’s Gate: A Comprehensive Technical Analysis of 2024 Chevrolet Silverado Global B Security, "All Keys Lost" Protocols, and Aftermarket Breakthroughs
1. Introduction: The Paradigm Shift in Automotive Access
The automotive security landscape has undergone a seismic shift with the introduction and proliferation of General Motors' "Global B" electrical architecture, also known as the Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP). The 2024 Chevrolet Silverado stands as a primary exemplar of this technological fortress, representing a definitive departure from the legacy Global A architecture that locksmiths and automotive security professionals have navigated for over a decade. For the locksmithing industry, the 2024 Silverado is not merely another vehicle; it is a testing ground for the viability of third-party intervention in an increasingly closed, encrypted, and cloud-dependent ecosystem.
This report serves as an exhaustive technical dossier for the professional locksmith tasked with an "All Keys Lost" (AKL) scenario on a 2024 Chevrolet Silverado. It moves beyond superficial instructional guides to provide a granular analysis of the underlying communication protocols (CAN FD), the cryptographic logic of the immobilizer handshake, the limitations and breakthroughs of current aftermarket hardware (Autel, OBDSTAR, Code Cannibal), and the critical "gotchas" that separate a successful programming event from a catastrophic module failure.
The analysis indicates that while the "All Keys Lost" scenario on a Global B Silverado is one of the most challenging procedures in modern automotive locksmithing, it is not insurmountable. However, success requires a fundamental re-education of the technician. The era of simple EEPROM manipulation or static PIN codes is ending. In its place is a dynamic, high-speed, server-dependent environment where the locksmith must operate as a network engineer, a systems integrator, and a security specialist simultaneously.
The 2024 model year represents a critical juncture. While earlier Global B implementations (2020-2022) have been partially cracked or reverse-engineered by aftermarket tool manufacturers, the 2024 Silverado introduces updated security patches and firmware revisions that have rendered many previous "bypass" methods obsolete. This has created a fractured landscape where some tools work on early-year production models while failing on late-year builds, leading to confusion and frustration in the field. Understanding the nuances of build dates, RPO codes, and software versions is now as important as the physical skill of cutting a key blade.
Furthermore, the integration of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and the necessity for high-bandwidth data transfer have forced GM to adopt the Controller Area Network with Flexible Data-Rate (CAN FD) protocol across the board for these vehicles. This physical layer change necessitates new hardware interfaces, meaning that the trusty OBD-II dongles of the past five years are physically incapable of communicating with the vehicle's immobilizer system. The locksmith must therefore invest in updated Voltage Communication Interfaces (VCIs) capable of negotiating these high-speed data streams without inducing signal reflection or packet loss, which can trigger the vehicle's anti-theft lockdown mode.


 Image 2. The Architecture of Exclusion: Understanding Global B and CAN FD
To master the 2024 Silverado, one must first respect the engineering that powers it. The Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP), colloquially known as Global B, was designed with two primary directives: to support the massive data throughput required for autonomous driving features and to secure the vehicle against cyber-physical attacks. For the locksmith, this dual purpose manifests as two distinct hurdles: bandwidth and encryption.
2.1 The Physics of Communication: CAN FD Explained
The 2024 Silverado utilizes Controller Area Network with Flexible Data-Rate (CAN FD). While standard CAN bus protocols (ISO 11898) operate at speeds up to 1 Mbit/s with a payload limited to 8 bytes per frame, CAN FD dramatically increases this capacity. Standard CAN has been the industry standard since the mid-2000s, sufficient for unlocking doors or reading simple engine parameters. However, the modern vehicle is effectively a rolling data center, and the legacy pipeline was becoming a bottleneck.
CAN FD allows for data transmission rates of up to 5 Mbit/s or higher during the data phase of the frame. This allows the vehicle's modules to exchange massive amounts of code—such as firmware updates or complex cryptographic keys—in milliseconds. Crucially, CAN FD extends the data field from 8 bytes to 64 bytes. This extension is not merely for speed; it allows for longer, more complex cryptographic tokens to be exchanged in a single "sentence" without the need for fragmentation, which enhances security by reducing the attack surface for "Man-in-the-Middle" exploits.
For the locksmith, the implication is physical. Legacy programming tools designed for standard CAN cannot physically interpret these signals. The bit timing is different; the arbitration phase switches speed mid-transmission. Without a CAN FD adapter (or a tool with internal CAN FD hardware like the Autel IM608 II or OBDSTAR G3), the tool will simply see "noise" or fail to communicate entirely. The voltage thresholds and timing requirements are stricter; a tool that "almost" works on a 2019 Silverado will fundamentally fail on a 2024 model because it cannot synchronize with the higher bit rates. This mandates the use of specific hardware adapters or updated VCI units, often adding cost and complexity to the job.
2.2 The Serial Data Gateway Module (SDGM)
In the Global A era, the OBD-II port (DLC) was often directly wired to the High-Speed CAN bus. A tool plugged into the port was effectively "inside" the network, able to broadcast wake-up commands to the Body Control Module (BCM) or Engine Control Module (ECM) with impunity. Locksmiths relied on this direct access to read EEPROM data, extract PIN codes, and command key learning procedures.
In the Global B architecture of the 2024 Silverado, the OBD-II port connects primarily to the Serial Data Gateway Module (SDGM). This module acts as a strict firewall. It inspects every message attempting to enter the vehicle network. Diagnostic requests, such as reading a Check Engine light or basic sensor data, are generally allowed through to comply with Right to Repair legislation. However, privileged commands—those required for key programming, such as "Write Data ID," "Unlock Immobilizer," or "Reset BCM"—are blocked by default.
To bypass this firewall, the programming tool must perform a specific authentication sequence. It must prove to the SDGM that it is an authorized device. This is where the difference between OEM tools and aftermarket "hacks" becomes apparent. The OEM tool uses a digital certificate downloaded from GM's servers to authenticate. Aftermarket tools must either emulate this certificate, which is risky and difficult, or exploit a vulnerability in the gateway to slip commands through. If the SDGM detects an anomaly, it can isolate the OBD port entirely, resulting in the dreaded "Communication Error" or "Device Control Not Available" messages.
2.3 The Cryptographic Handshake
The security mechanism is not static. It relies on a challenge-response protocol utilizing high-entropy encryption standards (likely AES-128 or higher). This is a significant upgrade from the fixed-seed or low-entropy rolling codes of previous generations.
When a programmer requests access, the vehicle generates a random number (the "seed" or "challenge"). The programmer must take this seed, combine it with a secret key, and run it through a specific mathematical algorithm to produce the "response." The vehicle compares the programmer's response with its own calculation. If they match, access is granted.
In 2024 models, this algorithm is incredibly complex and often requires online calculation. This is why tools like the Autel IM608 or OBDSTAR often require an active internet connection—they are sending the seed to a remote server farm in China to calculate the response because the tablet itself lacks the processing power or the database to do it locally. This introduces a new point of failure: the server status. If the aftermarket manufacturer's server is down, or if GM changes the algorithm (as they frequently do with OTA updates), the tool becomes a paperweight, regardless of the technician's skill.
3. The Tool Ecosystem: Capabilities, Limitations, and Workarounds
The market for programming the 2024 Silverado is fractured. There is no single "magic wand." The professional must choose between the reliability of the OEM path and the agility (and risk) of the aftermarket path. The choice of tool dictates the workflow, the cost structure, and the risk profile of the job.
3.1 The Official Path: Techline Connect (SPS2)
The gold standard for programming a 2024 Silverado remains the factory method. This is the only method guaranteed to work without risking a "bricked" module, provided the user has the correct credentials. It leverages the official GM back-end, ensuring that the security handshake is legitimate rather than spoofed.
Requirements and Setup:
* Hardware: A J2534 passthrough device is required. Interestingly, the Autel V200, which comes with the KM100 and IM508S, has been verified by field reports as a fully compliant J2534 interface that works perfectly with GM's software. This allows locksmiths to utilize existing hardware without purchasing the expensive GM MDI2.
* Software: A laptop running Windows 10/11 with Techline Connect installed. The software is resource-intensive and requires a stable, high-speed internet connection to download calibration files and security certificates in real-time.
* Credentials: A subscription to ACDelco TDS (approximately $45 per VIN) is necessary. Crucially, a NASTF VSP (Vehicle Security Professional) ID is required to access the immobilizer functions. Without this, the user is locked out of the key programming menus.
The "Hybrid" Innovation: A breakthrough for many locksmiths who do not own the expensive GM MDI2 interface is utilizing the Autel V200 as the bridge. This setup combines the low cost of aftermarket hardware with the high reliability of OEM software. The workflow involves purchasing the VIN slot, executing the "Serial Data Authentication Configuration" to satisfy the SDGM, and then proceeding to "Immobilizer Learn" -> "Add Key".
Insight: This method bypasses the "hacker" cat-and-mouse game entirely. By using official software, you are authenticating legitimately. The downside is the barrier to entry: the strict background check and bonding required for a NASTF VSP ID. However, for 2024 models where aftermarket exploits are not yet stable, this is often the only way to complete the job reliably.


 Image 3.2 The Aftermarket Heavyweights: Autel IM608 II and OBDSTAR G3
For those without NASTF credentials, the aftermarket provides the only alternative. However, the 2024 model year is a transitional zone where support is spotty, and marketing claims often outpace technical reality.
Autel IM608 Pro II: The IM608 II, with its upgraded Android 10 OS and faster processors , is significantly more capable than the original IM608. Speed is a critical factor when dealing with the tight timing windows of Global B protocols.
* AKL Support: While Autel lists support for "2020-2024" models, the reality on the ground is nuanced. For "All Keys Lost," the tool often cannot extract the PIN code via OBD-II for the 2024 Silverado without a working key to authorize the gateway access initially.
* The "Third-Party" PIN Workaround: The tool may prompt the user to obtain a PIN code from a "third party." This usually refers to purchasing a PIN code from a service that has access to GM's database by VIN. Once this 4-digit or multi-digit code is manually entered, the Autel can proceed with the programming. This adds a "hidden cost" to the job and a dependency on external data brokers.
* Innovation: Autel's "Smart Mode" attempts to automate the process, but on 2024 models, "Expert Mode" is often required to manually select the specific CAN FD protocol. Recent updates (v1.80) have specifically targeted 2024/2025 GM IMMO functions, aiming to stabilize the PIN reading capability.
OBDSTAR Key Master G3: OBDSTAR has emerged as a specialist favorite for GM vehicles, often releasing solutions faster than Autel. The G3 is purpose-built with internal CAN FD and a focus on proprietary algorithms.
* The "Free PIN" Claim: OBDSTAR marketing boldly claims "Proximity key free pincode add keys" for the 2024 Silverado. This implies a server-side calculation that exploits a vulnerability to derive the PIN without needing a working key.
* Reality Check: Field tests and community discussions suggest that while this works well for 2021-2022 models, the 2024 security patch level may block this "free pin" method, reverting the user to needing a dealer code or failing the "All Keys Lost" initialization. The server downtime mentioned in user discussions highlights the fragility of this method—if OBDSTAR's server in China cannot crack the seed, or is offline for maintenance, the tool fails mid-job.
3.3 The Budget Contender: Code Cannibal
Code Cannibal is frequently marketed as a budget-friendly alternative with unlimited tokens and specialized "all keys lost" cables. However, for a 2024 Global B vehicle, caution is advised.
* Architecture: It relies on similar underlying logic to other aftermarket tools but often with less frequent server updates.
* Market Position: Community feedback indicates that Code Cannibal is often viewed as a rebranded or similar hardware platform to other tools (like the AutoProPad G2), but with different software licensing.
* Limitation: While it may support "Add Key" if a working key is present, its ability to bypass the SDGM in a true "All Keys Lost" scenario on a 2024 CAN FD system is less documented and reliable than the major players. It is generally recommended as a backup tool rather than a primary solution for high-risk Global B jobs.
4. The "Gotchas": Critical Failure Points in 2024 Programming
The difference between a 15-minute job and a $2,000 tow to the dealership often lies in the "gotchas"—the subtle, undocumented nuances of the vehicle's behavior. In the 2024 Silverado, these are not just annoyances; they are critical failure points that can lead to a lockout state.
4.1 The Voltage Trap
Global B modules are notoriously sensitive to voltage fluctuation. During the programming phase—specifically the "Immobilizer Learn" cycle—the vehicle draws significant current as multiple modules (BCM, ECM, SDGM, Cluster, Infotainment) wake up and stay active to validate the new key.
* The Risk: If the voltage drops below roughly 12.5V during the writing of the new key ID, the BCM may enter a "panic" state or reset, corrupting the memory write process. This can leave the module in a bootloop or "secure lockout" state.
* The Fix: A standard jump pack is insufficient, as it provides a burst of power rather than steady regulation. A Continuous Power Supply Unit (PSU) capable of maintaining a steady 13.4V – 13.8V at 50-70 Amps is mandatory. Connecting this directly to the battery terminals before plugging in the VCI is the first step of any successful procedure.
4.2 The Prox Pocket Location Game
A recurring point of failure is the technician placing the key in the wrong spot during the "Learn" phase. If the key is not exactly on the Low Frequency (LF) antenna coil, the BCM cannot write the transponder data, resulting in "0004 Device Control Not Available" or simply a timeout.
* Bucket Seat Configuration: In models with the center console (LTZ, High Country), the pocket is typically in the front cup holder or a specific marked tray in the center console. This is the "standard" location most locksmiths expect.
* Bench Seat Configuration (The 2024 Curveball): On 2024 Silverados with the front bench seat (common in Work Truck trims), the pocket is hidden inside the fold-down armrest storage compartment. It is not in the cup holders on the dash or the seat back. The technician must fold down the center seat, open the storage lid, and locate the specific pocket contour at the bottom.
* Verification Trick: If a working key is available (or partially working), remove its battery and place it in the pocket. Try to start the car. If the Driver Information Center (DIC) says "No Remote Detected," you are in the wrong spot. If it attempts to start or gives a different message, you have found the sweet spot.


 Image 4.3 The "12-Minute" Security Wait
In older GM vehicles, the 10-minute wait was a standard security delay. On Global B, this wait time can vary or appear to hang. The system is performing a "brute force protection" delay.
* The Gotcha: The screen may not update, or the progress bar may freeze. This is not a crash; it is a security feature.
* The Discipline: Do not disconnect. The SDGM is enforcing a lockout. Interrupting this process can leave the BCM in a "bootloader" mode, effectively bricking the car until a hard battery reset (or worse, module replacement) is performed.
* Deep Sleep Reset: If a procedure fails, Global B modules often require a "Deep Sleep" to reset. This means turning everything off, closing all doors, locking the car (if possible), and waiting 15-20 minutes for the bus to go silent before trying again.
4.4 Part Number Mismatches
The 2024 Silverado uses a specific 434 MHz key fob. Using a look-alike fob from a 2019-2021 model (often 315 MHz or a different 433 MHz protocol) will result in a failure to program, often with generic error codes that send the locksmith on a wild goose chase diagnosing the car instead of the key.
* Correct Part: For the 2024 Silverado, the standard smart key is FCC ID: YG0G21TB2 operating at 434 MHz. The chip ID is NXP HITAG-PRO ID49 (128 Bit).
* Visual Check: The key looks identical to the previous generation 5-button fobs. The only way to verify is to check the FCC ID under the battery cover or use a key tool to read the frequency and chip type before attempting to program.
5. Deep Technical Insight: The "All Keys Lost" Workflow
The following procedure outlines the most successful "hybrid" workflow identified in current research, utilizing the Autel V200 hardware with OEM Techline Connect software. This is the recommended path for professional results when aftermarket tools fail to bypass the 2024 security patch.
Phase 1: Preparation
1. Power Stabilization: Connect the 13.8V PSU to the battery. Ensure the connection is solid and the voltage is stable.
2. Network Stability: Ensure the laptop has a hardwired ethernet connection or a very strong Wi-Fi signal. Techline Connect is cloud-native; packet loss results in authentication failure.
3. Hardware Hookup: Connect the V200 to the OBD-II port. Ensure the V200 firmware is updated via the Autel PC Suite.
4. Key Check: Verify the new key FCC ID (YG0G21TB2) and frequency (434 MHz).
Phase 2: Authentication
1. Launch the Techline Connect dashboard.
2. Log in with your user credentials and connect the V200 to the laptop via USB (preferred over Bluetooth for stability).
3. Select "Immobilizer Learn" from the Service Programming System (SPS2) menu.
4. CRITICAL STEP: Before attempting to add keys, run the "Serial Data Authentication Configuration" function.
   * Insight: This function resynchronizes the security certificates between the Gateway (SDGM) and the BCM. Many failures occur because the locksmith skips straight to "Add Key" while the modules are out of sync due to the previous lost key event or low battery.
Phase 3: The Learning Process
1. Select "Program Transponder or Remote Key (Add)".
   * Note: Even in AKL, "Add" is often the safer path if the menu allows, as "Replace ECU" is destructive and resets more parameters than necessary. However, for true AKL where no authorized key exists to turn on the ignition, the system will default to a specific "Unlearned" mode or require the "Immobilizer Learn - Setup" function.
2. Ignition Force: The tool may ask to "Press Start Button." Since there is no working key, the ignition will not turn on fully. You are effectively just waking up the BCM to listen.
3. The Slot: Place the new, unprogrammed key in the specific pocket identified in Section 4.2. Ensure no other keys are within 3 meters of the vehicle to prevent interference.
4. The Write: The software will command the BCM to write the unique ID of the new key into the "Allowed" list. This process may take several minutes.
5. Verification: Once the software says "Complete," remove the key, close the driver's door, wait 10 seconds, and test all functions (Lock, Unlock, Remote Start).
6. Clear DTCs: The process will inevitably set communication codes (U-codes). Use the diagnostic function to clear these to ensure the "Service Theft Deterrent" message is cleared from the dash.
6. Innovative Breakthroughs and Future Outlook
The locksmith industry is adapting to the Global B reality with several innovative approaches that blend traditional skills with IT methodologies.
6.1 The "SPS-to-Go" Model
A growing trend among locksmiths is the "SPS-to-Go" setup. Instead of buying a $5,000 MDI2, technicians are realizing that J2534 devices they already own (like the Autel V200 or specialized cables from OBDSTAR) pass the strict requirements for GM's Techline Connect. This democratizes access to OEM-level programming. The innovation here is hardware agnosticism—using cheap hardware with premium software to achieve factory-level results.
6.2 Server-Side Emulation
Advanced tools like the OBDSTAR G3 are beginning to employ server-side emulation of the OEM security certificates. Instead of cracking the encryption on the device, they mimic the digital signature of a legitimate dealer tool. The tool reads the seed, sends it to a server where a virtualized OEM session might be running, retrieves the response, and feeds it back to the car. This is a breakthrough in "spoofing" technology, though it remains a precarious legal and technical grey area. As GM updates their SDGM certificates (which they do over-the-air), these tools will require constant firmware patches to maintain the spoof.
6.3 The Move to "Authorized" Locksmithing
The friction of Global B is driving the industry toward legitimacy. The "breakthrough" for many businesses is not a new hacking tool, but the integration of NASTF credentials into their business model. By becoming a Vehicle Security Professional (VSP), the locksmith transforms the "All Keys Lost" job from a 2-hour hack-fest into a 20-minute standard procedure. The 2024 Silverado is the vehicle that is forcing this transition. The initial cost of the subscription is offset by the elimination of failed jobs and the ability to charge premium rates for "dealer-level" service on-site.

	"Service Steering Column Lock"
	BCM/ESCL synchronization failure post-programming.
	1. Disconnect battery negative terminal for 5 minutes. 2. Cycle ignition On/Off 3 times (press Start button without brake). 3. Clear DTCs in BCM and ESCL.
	8. Conclusion: The New Standard of Competence
The 2024 Chevrolet Silverado All Keys Lost scenario is a litmus test for the modern locksmith. It unforgivingly punishes those who rely on rote memorization of button presses on a tablet. It rewards those who understand network topology, voltage regulation, and the administrative layer of automotive security.
The "gotchas" are physical (pocket location), electrical (voltage stability), and digital (CAN FD protocols). The "breakthroughs" are less about magic devices and more about the convergence of aftermarket hardware with OEM software protocols. For the locksmith standing before a locked 2024 Silverado, the path to success is clear but narrow: respect the architecture, power the system, and choose the right weapon. In the era of the Vehicle Intelligence Platform, the locksmith is no longer just cutting metal; they are authenticating identity in a high-security digital environment.

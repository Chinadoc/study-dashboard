Technical Report: Operational Procedures for 128-Bit PATS Encryption in Late-Model Ford Vehicles (2019–2026)
1. Introduction to the Gen 5 Security Architecture
The automotive security landscape has undergone a radical and permanent transformation with the introduction of 128-bit encryption in Ford’s Passive Anti-Theft System (PATS), specifically within the "Gen 5" architecture. This shift, which began appearing sporadically in 2018 but became the dominant standard with the introduction of the Gen 14 F-150 and the CD6 Explorer platform around 2020/2021, marks a definitive departure from the legacy 40-bit and 80-bit Texas Instruments (TI) encryption standards that defined the previous two decades of Ford locksmithing.1 For the automotive locksmith and security professional, the implications are profound. The 128-bit transponder, often utilizing NXP Hitag Pro or similar high-security protocols, is no longer a static element that simply responds to a Low-Frequency (LF) excitation signal with a fixed or simple rolling code. It is now part of a complex, time-sensitive, bidirectional challenge-response handshake involving the Body Control Module (BCM), the Gateway Module (GWM), and often the Ford cloud servers.2
The transition from the Gen 3 (80-bit) architecture, which launched prominently around 2011 with the F-150 and migrated across the fleet, to the Gen 5 (128-bit) system represents more than just a cryptographic upgrade. It entails a fundamental change in how the vehicle verifies ownership. In the 80-bit era, the handshake was largely contained within the vehicle; the BCM challenged the key, the key responded, and the BCM authorized the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) to enable the fuel injectors.2 While an "Incode/Outcode" exchange was required for programming, it was a static mathematical hurdle that aftermarket tools could calculate locally or via simple databases. The 128-bit era, however, introduces cloud dependency and "rolling code" bidirectional authentication that binds the key programming process to real-time verification servers.4
This report serves as an exhaustive operational guide for the 128-bit era. It details specific All Keys Lost (AKL) and Add Key procedures for the critical 2019–2026 fleet: F-150, Explorer, Mustang, Bronco, Bronco Sport, and Maverick. It evaluates the efficacy of three primary tool ecosystems—Autel IM608 Pro II, Advanced Diagnostics Smart Pro, and the OEM Ford Diagnostic & Repair System (FDRS)—and provides rigid, database-ready procedural blocks for integration into technical workflows. Furthermore, it addresses the high-risk "Starting System Fault" failure mode and the procedural necessity of decoupling telematics prior to programming.6
2. System Identification and Architecture
2.1 The 128-Bit Transponder Standard
The industry colloquially refers to the new standard as "128-bit," but this nomenclature simplifies the underlying technology. The system utilizes an AES-128 encryption standard for the immobilizer handshake, providing a significantly larger key space that makes brute-force attacks computationally infeasible.1 Unlike the 80-bit system, which could often be calculated offline or cloned onto specialized carbon or glass chips, the 128-bit system requires a proprietary calculation that typically forces an online connection to a server. This is evident in the operation of modern programming tools, which must upload data dumps to a manufacturer's server (such as Autel's cloud or Advanced Diagnostics' server) to solve the security algorithm.5
For the technician in the field, identifying these systems prior to attempting programming is critical to avoiding "bricked" modules. The mechanical key blade itself offers the first clue. For bladed keys found in lower trim levels of the Maverick or F-150 XL, the mechanical key often features a "twisted" head geometry, distinct from the flat H-key (80-bit) used in 2015-2020 models.1 These are often referred to as "T-keys" in the aftermarket, although the blade profile remains the standard HU101 high-security mill. It is crucial to note that while the blade profile is identical to the H94 (80-bit) key, the transponder chips are fundamentally incompatible. Attempting to program an 80-bit H-chip into a 128-bit system will result in a failed programming attempt, often without a clear error message explaining the mismatch.1
The most reliable method of identification lies in the hardware part numbers. The Body Control Module (BCM) part number series is the definitive indicator of the underlying architecture.
* ML3T / ML3Z Series: This prefix indicates the Gen 14 F-150 architecture (2021+). These BCMs are heavily integrated with the Gateway Module and require CAN FD communication.9
* MU5T / MU5Z Series: This prefix indicates the C2 platform architecture, utilized by the Bronco Sport, Maverick, and Escape.11
* JU5T / JU5Z Series: This prefix is typically associated with the Super Duty and earlier iterations of the high-security architecture.14
Aftermarket key shells and transponders have adapted to this shift. Locksmiths must stock "L128" or "H128" transponders. In many cases, aftermarket suppliers refer to these as "PT128" chips. A common pitfall is the visual similarity between the 80-bit and 128-bit keys; without a dedicated transponder reader to check the bit depth (Hitag Pro vs. DST80), they are indistinguishable to the naked eye.1
2.2 CAN FD and the Gateway Module
A critical barrier to entry for 2021+ Ford vehicles is the adoption of CAN FD (Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate). This protocol allows for significantly faster data transmission—up to 5 Mbps compared to the 500 kbps of classic CAN. This speed is necessary to handle the massive data throughput of modern vehicle architectures, which include advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), over-the-air (OTA) updates, and complex infotainment integration.17
However, this shift renders older OBD-II interfaces (VCI) obsolete. Standard J2534 interfaces that are not CAN FD compliant cannot communicate with the vehicle's network.
* F-150 (2021+): This vehicle utilizes a Gateway Module (GWM) that actively filters OBD traffic. Programming requires a VCI capable of CAN FD, such as the Autel V200, VCI V3, or the Smart Pro with specifically designed ADC2000/2020 cables.4
* Active Alarm Bypass: A significant hurdle in 2020+ models is the Active Alarm system. If the vehicle is locked and the alarm is triggered (which is the default state in an All Keys Lost scenario), the BCM isolates the CAN lines to prevent unauthorized "hot-wiring" via the OBD port. Procedures now require specific "Alarm Bypass" cables or software routines. These tools emulate a working key signal or inject a specific wake-up command to silence the alarm and open the communication gateway before programming can commence.18

	3. Tool Ecosystem Analysis
The capability of aftermarket tools to handle Ford's 128-bit encryption has evolved rapidly. Early in the lifecycle of the 2021 F-150, dealer software was the only option. Today, mature solutions exist, but they come with caveats regarding internet connectivity, subscription models, and hardware add-ons.


  



3.1 Autel IM608 Pro II / IM508S
The Autel ecosystem has aggressively targeted the 128-bit challenge, releasing major "Password Free" updates (Software V2.00+) throughout 2024 and 2025.8
* Capability: The tool can perform AKL on F-150 (2021+), Bronco, and Maverick without requiring a dealer code or NASTF credentials if the device has an active Total Care Program (TCP) subscription and internet access. The "password free" claim refers to the user experience; the tool handles the cryptographic heavy lifting in the background via Autel's servers.8
* Hardware Requirements:
   * V200 or MaxiFlash JVCI+: These interfaces support CAN FD natively. Users with the older black JVCI (from the original IM608) must use the CAN FD Adapter or upgrade their VCI.17
   * G-BOX3: This breakout box is increasingly recommended for "All Keys Lost" situations. It allows the tool to power the BCM directly or intercept CAN lines for faster calculation, reducing the time required to derive the security data.22
* Methodology: The procedure relies on a "server-calculated" bypass. The tool reads the BCM data (either via a "dump" of the EEPROM or a specialized OBD readout), uploads this data to the Autel server, calculates the necessary security blocks, and writes the new key data back to the vehicle.8 This dependency on the server means that if the subscription lapses or the server is down, the tool is non-functional for these vehicles.
3.2 Advanced Diagnostics Smart Pro
The Smart Pro takes a modular software approach, offering high stability but at a higher operational cost.
* Software Modules: ADS2269 was the standard for 2018-2020 vehicles. The newer ADS2325 (and subsequent updates) covers the 2021+ models, including the Maverick and F-150.24
* Hardware: The ADC2000 master cable is standard. However, the critical component for AKL scenarios is the ADC2020 active alarm bypass cable (or emulator). This hardware emulator physically mimics a valid transponder signal to the BCM to disarm the alarm system. This bypass is significant because it reduces the "wait time"—often a mandatory 10-minute security delay—to under 3 minutes.19
* Economics: The Smart Pro operates on a token system. 128-bit programming typically consumes tokens for the bypass calculation. While the upfront cost for cables like the ADC2020 is high, the tool's reliability in "Active Alarm" situations makes it a favorite for repo work or high-pressure lockout scenarios where speed is paramount.20
3.3 Ford FDRS (OEM)
The Ford Diagnostic & Repair System (FDRS) is the "Nuclear Option." When aftermarket tools fail, corrupt a module, or trigger a "Starting System Fault," FDRS is often the only recovery path.
* Requirement: Accessing key programming functions ("PATS Functions") requires a valid NASTF VSP (Vehicle Security Professional) ID. This is a regulated credential requiring background checks and insurance.27
* Hardware: A VCM3 is the standard dealer interface, but a J2534-compliant pass-thru device (like the Autel VCI or other J-Box) can also be used with the FDRS software subscription.29
* Procedure: The workflow involves navigating to "Toolbox" > "Body" > "Security" > "PATS Functions." The software then authenticates with the Secure Data Release Model (SDRM) server to authorize the key programming session.31 While bureaucratic, this method is 100% reliable as it uses the official Ford database.
4. Vehicle-Specific Procedures (Database Extraction)
The following sections detailed structured YAML blocks required for the tool_vehicle_procedures database. Each block is synthesized from the cross-referencing of tool capabilities, forum verification, and video evidence. These procedures are designed to be ingested by a technical database to guide technicians in the field.
4.1 Ford F-150 (2021-2026)
The Gen 14 F-150 represents the highest difficulty tier in the current Ford lineup due to the GWM and CAN FD requirements. The procedure differs significantly depending on whether the alarm is active. The Active Alarm status essentially "locks down" the OBD port, necessitating a bypass strategy.
Procedure 1: Autel IM608 Pro II (AKL)
This procedure assumes the use of the "Password Free" software update (v2.00+), which leverages the Autel server for calculation.

4.2 Ford Bronco & Bronco Sport (2021-2026)
While they share a nameplate, these two vehicles are built on vastly different architectures. The Bronco uses the T6 platform (shared with the Ranger), similar to the F-150. The Bronco Sport utilizes the C2 platform (shared with the Escape). A frequent pain point for locksmiths working on the Bronco Sport is locating the programming slot. Unlike the F-150's cupholder slot, the Bronco Sport's slot is hidden at the bottom of the center console storage bin, often covered by a thick rubber mat that must be removed.

4.3 Ford Maverick (2022-2026)
The Maverick, also on the C2 architecture, presents a unique challenge because it commonly features bladed keys (H128) in lower trims (XL/XLT), while the Lariat trim uses Intelligent Access (Prox). The bladed key system requires two unique keys to close the programming cycle in an All Keys Lost situation, a requirement that often catches technicians off guard if they only brought one blank.

5. Critical Failures and Recovery
5.1 The "Starting System Fault" Nightmare
The "Starting System Fault" message on the instrument cluster is the most dreaded outcome of a failed programming attempt. It indicates a fundamental mismatch between the recognized key ID and the BCM's authorized list, or a failure in the encrypted handshake between the BCM and the PCM. This fault can leave the vehicle in a "no-start" condition even if the key appears to be programmed (i.e., the remote locks work).6
Root Causes:
1. Programming Interruption: A loss of internet connectivity during the "Server Calculation" phase on tools like Autel or Smart Pro can leave the BCM in an undefined state.
2. Fuse Box Connection (Physical): In the F-150 (2021+), the BCM (located behind the kick panel in the passenger footwell) has connectors secured with a "light gray locking lever." These levers are notorious for being kicked loose by passengers or not being fully seated from the factory. A loose connection here causes intermittent PATS failures, which may coincide with programming attempts.32
3. Low Voltage Corruption: If the vehicle voltage drops below 12.0V during the write cycle, the BCM EEPROM can become corrupted.
Recovery Procedure:
1. Hard Reset: Disconnect the negative battery terminal for 15 minutes. This allows the volatile memory in the BCM and Gateway to clear.
2. Connector Inspection: Physically unlatch and reseat the C2280A, C2280B, and C2280C connectors on the BCM. Ensure the gray lever "clicks" fully home.
3. Fuse Verification: Check Fuse #9 (Passenger Compartment) which often powers the PATS transceiver, and Fuses #26 & #27 (Engine Bay) which relate to the PCM and BCM logic.32
4. FDRS PMI: If the module is truly "bricked" (unresponsive to aftermarket tools), the only solution is to use FDRS to perform a "Programmable Module Installation" (PMI). This process downloads the original As-Built data from Ford's server and rewrites the BCM configuration, effectively factory-resetting the module to its pre-failure state.


  



5.2 FordPass and the "Cloud Immobilizer"
The FordPass app introduces a unique "Connected Car" complication. If a user has "Phone as Key" (PaaK) active, the vehicle's BCM is constantly polling for the phone's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. This can conflict with the programming of new physical keys, causing the vehicle to reject the new transponder ID.
* Conflict: The BCM prioritizes the BLE signal from the phone over the LF signal from the backup slot.
* Resolution: It is imperative to delink the vehicle from the previous owner's FordPass account before selling or programming new keys if conflicts arise.
   * Method 1 (Screen): On the vehicle's Sync screen, navigate to Settings > General > Reset > Master Reset. This wipes all PaaK data and disassociates the modem from the cloud account.33
   * Method 2 (App): If the phone is not present, a Master Reset is the only option.
   * Symptoms: The key programs successfully (door locks cycle), but the vehicle displays "No Key Detected" when attempting to start via the backup slot. This indicates the BCM is ignoring the slot in favor of a missing phone key.
6. Detailed Technical Insights
6.1 The "Password Free" Misnomer
Marketing materials from tool manufacturers often tout "Password Free" solutions for 2021+ Fords. This phrasing is technically misleading. The password (or "Incode") is still required by the PATS system to authorize the key learning session. What has changed is the delivery method.
* Legacy (80-bit): The locksmith read an "Outcode" from the screen, used a calculator or service to get the "Incode," and typed it in manually.
* Modern (128-bit): The tool reads the raw data dump from the BCM, sends it to the manufacturer's server (e.g., Autel cloud), the server performs the cryptographic calculation (mimicking the dealer tool's challenge-response), and sends the result back to the tablet. The user never "sees" the password, hence "Password Free."
* Implication: This means that if your tool subscription expires, or if you are working in a cellular dead zone, you cannot program these keys. "Offline" programming for 128-bit Ford is effectively dead in the aftermarket.8
6.2 The Rise of Third-Party "Cheat Codes"
A gray market has emerged for "Incode calculation" services (e.g., NASTF bypass services).
* Mechanism: These services likely have access to a compromised dealer credential or have reverse-engineered the seed-key generator algorithm.
* Risk: Ford actively monitors for abnormal request patterns. Using these services can flag the VIN or "blacklist" the BCM on the Ford server, making future dealer service impossible without replacing the module.
* Recommendation: Stick to official tool paths (Autel Subscription, Smart Pro Tokens, or NASTF/FDRS) to ensure the longevity of the vehicle's module.28
6.3 Battery Support is Non-Negotiable
With CAN FD and the multitude of modules waking up during programming (Sync 4, Modem, Digital Cluster, BCM, GWM), the static current draw on a 2021+ F-150 can exceed 25 Amps with the ignition ON/Engine OFF.
* A standard portable jump pack is often insufficient to maintain stable voltage under this load for the duration of a session.
* Requirement: A professional voltage stabilizer (Maintainer) capable of holding 13.5V constant at 50A load is mandatory. Voltage drops cause the GWM to shut down the programming port mid-process, leading to the dreaded "bricked" state where the module is stuck in bootloader mode.
7. Conclusion
The transition to 128-bit PATS represents the most significant increase in Ford anti-theft security in a decade. Success in this environment requires a shift in mindset from "eeprom and cloning" to "network management and server authentication."
For the operational locksmith or technician:
1. Invest in Connectivity: A robust LTE hotspot is now as important as the key programmer itself due to the server-dependent nature of modern PATS.
2. Update Hardware: Legacy VCIs cannot handle the CAN FD traffic of the F-150 and Bronco. Upgrading to V200, VCM3, or Smart Pro ADC2000 is mandatory.
3. Respect the Alarm: The Active Alarm is no longer a nuisance; it is a firewall. Bypassing it via hardware (ADC2020) or correct software procedure is the first step of any AKL job to ensure OBD port access.
4. Embrace FDRS: For 2024+ models (Mustang S650), the aftermarket gap is widening. Obtaining NASTF credentials is the only way to guarantee 100% coverage and recovery capability.
By following the structured procedures outlined in this report and heeding the critical alerts regarding power stability and connectivity, technicians can maintain high success rates despite the escalating complexity of Ford's security architecture.

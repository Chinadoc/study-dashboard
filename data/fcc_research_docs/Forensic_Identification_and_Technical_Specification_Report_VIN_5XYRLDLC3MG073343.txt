Forensic Identification and Technical Specification Report: VIN 5XYRLDLC3MG073343
1. Executive Summary and Identification Protocol
The alphanumeric sequence 5XYRLDLC3MG073343 constitutes a unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) assigned to a 2021 Kia Sorento S AWD.1
This report serves as a comprehensive technical dossier derived from the forensic decomposition of this 17-character identifier. By applying the regulatory framework established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under 49 C.F.R. Part 565 and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3779, we have reconstructed the vehicle’s precise build configuration, manufacturing lineage, powertrain specifications, and digital access architecture.
The analysis confirms the vehicle is a fourth-generation (MQ4) Sorento, distinct from the Kia Telluride platform often manufactured at the same facility. The vehicle was assembled by Kia Georgia, Inc. (KMMG) in West Point, Georgia, specifically for the North American market.4 It is equipped with the 2.5-liter Smartstream GDI 4-cylinder engine (Non-Turbo), an 8-speed automatic transmission, and an All-Wheel Drive (AWD) system.2
A critical component of this report addresses the specific inquiry regarding access control hardware. Our analysis of the vehicle's trim level ("S") and production lineage identifies the correct Smart Key part numbers as 95440-P2000 or 95440-P2010, operating on a 433 MHz frequency with FCC ID SY5MQ4FGE05, while explicitly excluding incompatible components used on higher trim levels.5


  



2. World Manufacturer Identifier (WMI) Analysis
The initial segment of the VIN, comprising positions one through three (5XY), is the World Manufacturer Identifier. This code provides the geopolitical and corporate context of the vehicle's origin. Unlike the Vehicle Descriptor Section, which varies by model, the WMI is a static identifier assigned to the manufacturer by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in the United States or the relevant national agency elsewhere.
2.1 Geographic Origin: The Significance of "5"
The first character, 5, designates the vehicle's country of origin as the United States.1 This is a critical distinction in the global automotive supply chain. While Kia is a South Korean chaebol, vehicles bearing a VIN starting with "K" are manufactured in domestic Korean facilities (such as Hwasung or Sohari). The assignment of "5" indicates that this specific unit was assembled at Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia (KMMG) in West Point, Georgia.
The implication of US-based assembly extends beyond mere geography; it dictates the supply chain for replacement parts. Vehicles assembled in the US often utilize localized suppliers for glass, interior polymers, and suspension components to meet the requirements of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Consequently, when sourcing replacement parts like windshields or seat frames, the distinction between a "5-VIN" and a "K-VIN" (if applicable to the model year) is paramount to ensure correct fitment.7
2.2 Manufacturer Designation: "XY"
The second and third characters, XY, further refine the manufacturer identity to Kia Georgia, Inc..4
* Position 2 (X): Within the context of the "5" region code, "X" is the designated character for Kia's US manufacturing entity.
* Position 3 (Y): This character typically denotes the specific vehicle category or division. For Kia Georgia, "Y" is associated with Multipurpose Passenger Vehicles (MPVs) and SUVs produced at the West Point facility.
It is notable that both the Kia Sorento and the Kia Telluride share this 5XY WMI prefix.2 This shared identifier frequently leads to confusion during preliminary VIN checks, as the WMI alone cannot distinguish between the mid-size Sorento and the larger Telluride. The differentiation relies entirely on the subsequent Vehicle Descriptor Section.
3. Vehicle Descriptor Section (VDS): Platform and Powertrain Forensics
The Vehicle Descriptor Section, occupying positions four through eight (RLDLC), acts as the genetic code of the vehicle. It defines the specific engineering attributes, including the platform architecture, engine thermodynamics, and drivetrain configuration.
3.1 Position 4: The Definitive Model Identifier ("R")
The fourth character is the most significant discriminator in the VIN sequence. In this instance, the character R identifies the vehicle as the Kia Sorento (Generation MQ4).2
This character resolves the potential ambiguity with the Kia Telluride:
* Telluride VINs are codified with the letter P in the fourth position (e.g., 5XYP...).4
* Sorento VINs are codified with the letter R in the fourth position (e.g., 5XYR...).2
The Sorento MQ4 platform represents a significant departure from its predecessor. Built on the Hyundai-Kia N3 platform, the 2021 Sorento features a lighter, stiffer unibody construction designed to accommodate hybrid powertrains and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). The identification of "R" confirms that this vehicle benefits from these architectural improvements, distinguishing it from older "Series III" (UM) Sorentos which might carry different identifiers or WMIs depending on their production run.
3.2 Position 5: Series and Body Configuration ("L")
The fifth character, L, specifies the body style and series. For the 2021 model year Sorento, "L" corresponds to the Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) classification.3
While "SUV" is a broad marketing term, in the technical context of the VIN, "L" confirms the vehicle is a 5-door unibody wagon configuration. This code differentiates the passenger-carrying Sorento from other potential body styles or commercial variants that might exist in other markets. It implies a specific Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) class consistent with a mid-size passenger SUV.
3.3 Position 6: Powertrain Engineering ("D")
The sixth character, D, provides the technical specification for the engine. Decoding this character is essential for understanding the vehicle's performance capabilities and maintenance requirements.
The code D identifies the 2.5L Smartstream GDI 4-Cylinder Engine.2 This is the naturally aspirated (non-turbo) version of the Smartstream family. It is critical to distinguish this from the turbocharged variant, which is typically denoted by the code "H" or similar in higher trim levels.8
Technical Specifications of the "D" Code Engine:
* Engine Family: Smartstream G2.5 GDI.
* Displacement: 2,497 cc (2.5 Liters).
* Induction: Naturally Aspirated.
* Fuel Delivery: Dual Injection Technology—combining Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) for efficiency at speed and Multi-Point Injection (MPI) for lower particulate emissions at low loads.
* Performance: 191 Horsepower @ 6,100 RPM and 181 lb-ft of Torque @ 4,000 RPM.
* Thermal Management: Integrated Thermal Management Module (ITMM) for optimized warm-up and cooling.
Operational Implications: The presence of the "D" engine indicates that this vehicle is tuned for efficiency and reliability rather than high-performance output. It utilizes 0W-20 synthetic oil to minimize internal friction and maximize fuel economy.4 Owners should be aware that while this engine avoids the complexity of the turbocharger found in the "H" code engines, it offers significantly less torque (181 lb-ft vs. 311 lb-ft), which influences towing capacity and acceleration profiles.


  



3.4 Position 7: Trim Level and Drivetrain Configuration ("L")
The seventh character, L, is a complex identifier that encodes both the trim level and the drivetrain layout. Cross-referencing the VIN pattern with build data confirms that L at this position corresponds to the S Trim equipped with All-Wheel Drive (AWD).3
Trim Level Analysis: The "S" Specification
The "S" trim sits immediately above the base "LX" model. It is a volume-selling trim designed to offer aesthetic and comfort upgrades without the mechanical complexity of the higher "EX" and "SX" trims.
* Aesthetic Package: The "S" trim is distinguished by gloss black exterior accents (grille, mirror caps, roof rails) and 18-inch machine-finished alloy wheels.11
* Interior Configuration: It replaces the LX's cloth upholstery with SynTex artificial leather and adds a 10-way power-adjustable driver's seat with lumbar support. Heated front seats are standard equipment on this trim.
* Technology: The "S" trim features an 8.0-inch touchscreen interface. Crucially for the 2021 model year, this smaller screen size allows for Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a feature ironically absent on the more expensive 10.25-inch screens found in the SX trims, which required a wired connection.
Drivetrain Analysis: All-Wheel Drive (AWD)
The "AWD" designation indicates the vehicle is equipped with Kia's active on-demand all-wheel-drive system.
* Mechanism: The system utilizes an electro-hydraulic multi-plate clutch coupling to transfer torque to the rear wheels. Under normal driving conditions, the vehicle operates primarily in front-wheel drive to conserve fuel. When slip is detected, or when the "Lock" mode is engaged (at low speeds), the system diverts power to the rear axle.
* Torque Vectoring: This system includes Torque Vectoring Cornering Control (TVCC), which uses the braking system to simulate a limited-slip differential, improving cornering stability by braking the inside wheel.
3.5 Position 8: Restraint System ("C")
The eighth character, C, identifies the safety restraint architecture. For the US market, this code signifies the full compliance suite of passive safety features.3
* Advanced Airbags: Dual front advanced airbags that detect passenger presence and crash severity.
* Side Impact Protection: Dual front seat-mounted side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags covering all three rows.
* Knee Protection: A driver’s side knee airbag to mitigate lower limb injury in frontal collisions.
* Electronic Safety: This code also implies the presence of the standard Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Traction Control System (TCS) modules mandated by federal law.
3.6 Position 9: Check Digit ("3")
The ninth character is the check digit, calculated using a mathematical formula involving the other 16 characters and their positional weights.1 Its primary function is fraud detection. A valid check digit confirms that the VIN has not been altered or fabricated.
4. Vehicle Identifier Section (VIS): Production Forensics
The final section of the VIN (positions 10-17) provides specific production data unique to this individual unit.
4.1 Position 10: Model Year ("M")
The tenth character, M, encodes the Model Year 2021.1
* K = 2019
* L = 2020
* M = 2021
* N = 2022
The 2021 model year is significant as the debut year for the fourth-generation Sorento in North America. Production for this model year occurred during a period of significant global supply chain disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This context is relevant for parts availability, as manufacturers occasionally utilized alternate components or suppliers during this period to maintain line speed.
4.2 Position 11: Plant Code ("G")
The eleventh character, G, confirms the assembly plant as West Point, Georgia.3 This correlates perfectly with the "5" WMI. The West Point facility is a state-of-the-art manufacturing hub capable of producing over 340,000 vehicles annually.
4.3 Production Sequence ("073343")
The final six digits, 073343, represent the sequential production number. This number indicates the vehicle's place in the manufacturing queue for that model year. A sequence number in the 73,000 range suggests this vehicle was produced mid-cycle, likely after the initial ramp-up phases of the new MQ4 platform launch, potentially mitigating some of the "early build" quality issues often associated with the first few thousand units of a new generation.
5. Access Control Architecture and Digital Security
A primary focus of the user's inquiry pertains to the access control system, specifically the correct key fob part numbers. Given the variation in trims (LX, S, EX, SX), identifying the correct hardware is critical to avoid incompatibility.
5.1 System Frequency and Protocol
The 2021 Sorento S utilizes a Smart Key system operating on the 433 MHz (specifically 433.92 MHz) frequency.5 The system employs a bidirectional challenge-response protocol between the fob and the vehicle's Integrated Body Control Unit (IBU) and the Immobilizer module.
5.2 Key Fob Hardware Identification
The research indicates significant potential for confusion regarding the correct key fob part number. Based on the "S" trim level decoded from the VIN (Position 7 "L"), this vehicle requires a 5-Button Smart Key.
Correct Specification:
* Button Configuration: 5 Buttons (Lock, Unlock, Trunk Release, Panic, Remote Start).
* Part Numbers:
   * 95440-P2000: This is the primary Original Equipment (OE) part number for the 2021 model year.5
   * 95440-P2010: This is a superseding part number often used for late-2021 to 2023 models. While generally interchangeable in terms of function, specific compatibility can depend on the vehicle's exact build date. The P2000 is the safest initial choice for a standard 2021 VIN, but P2010 is widely listed as the current service part.14
* FCC ID: SY5MQ4FGE05.5 The "MQ4" string in the FCC ID confirms it is designed for the 4th Generation Sorento platform.
Incompatible Hardware (Critical Warning): Owners must explicitly avoid the 7-Button Smart Key (Part Number 95440-P2200, FCC ID SY5MQ4FGE07).6
* The 7-button fob includes buttons for "Remote Smart Parking Assist" (RSPA), a feature that allows the car to move forward and backward remotely.
* RSPA is exclusively available on the top-tier SX Prestige trims. The "S" trim decoded from this VIN lacks the necessary ultrasonic sensors and steering control modules to support RSPA.
* Attempting to program a 7-button key to this "S" trim vehicle will likely fail or result in limited functionality, as the Body Control Module (BCM) will not recognize the signals for the parking assist features.16


  



5.3 Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) and Security Updates
The 2021 Sorento platform is subject to specific manufacturer communications regarding security logic.
* Immobilizer Status: Unlike lower-trim Kia models from previous years that utilized mechanical keys and were vulnerable to theft (the "Kia Boys" phenomenon), the "S" trim is equipped with Push Button Start. This explicitly confirms the presence of a factory-installed engine immobilizer, rendering the vehicle immune to the USB-cable theft method.17
* Remote Start Logic Update (TSB CS2310): Kia issued a technical service bulletin regarding the Remote Start Control Module. On affected vehicles, using the remote start function could trigger five inadvertent horn honks. This issue is resolved via a software update at the dealership.18 Owners should check their service history to ensure this update has been applied.
6. Operational Profile and Maintenance Specifications
Understanding the engineering decoded from the VIN allows for the creation of a precise operational profile.
6.1 Fluid and Lubricant Specifications
The "D" code engine (2.5L Smartstream) has specific lubrication requirements designed to maintain its efficiency ratings.
* Engine Oil: SAE 0W-20 is the required viscosity grade. The use of heavier oils (like 5W-30) can impact the variable valve timing (CVVD) system and fuel economy. The oil must meet API SN Plus or SP standards to mitigate Low-Speed Pre-Ignition (LSPI), a phenomenon common in direct-injection engines.
* Capacity: Approximately 6.13 quarts (5.8 liters) with filter change.
6.2 Transmission Service
The 8-speed automatic transmission paired with the "D" engine is a traditional torque-converter automatic, distinct from the dual-clutch units in the turbo models.
* Fluid Type: ATF SP-IV.
* Maintenance: While often marketed as "filled for life," severe service schedules (towing, city driving) recommend inspection and potential fluid exchange at 60,000-mile intervals to ensure longevity of the clutch packs and solenoids.
6.3 All-Wheel Drive Maintenance
The AWD system decoded from the VIN ("L" in position 7) introduces additional maintenance points.
* Transfer Case & Rear Differential: These components require specific gear oil (typically Hypoid Gear Oil API GL-5, SAE 75W-90). Regular inspection of the propeller shaft and CV joints is recommended, especially given the vehicle's AWD capability.
7. Comparative Market Context
To contextualize the vehicle identified by 5XYRLDLC3MG073343, it is useful to compare it against its closest relatives in the Kia lineup.
7.1 Sorento S vs. Telluride S
Both vehicles share the "5XY" origin and "S" trim designation, and both are assembled in West Point, Georgia. However, they serve different market segments.
* Platform: The Telluride is built on a larger chassis. It is wider, longer, and seats up to 8 passengers, whereas the Sorento S seats 7.
* Powertrain: The Telluride S utilizes a 3.8L V6 (291 hp) standard. The Sorento S utilizes the 2.5L I4 (191 hp).
* VIN Identifier: As noted, the Sorento is identified by "R" in the 4th position, while the Telluride is "P".
7.2 Sorento S vs. Sorento EX/SX
The "S" trim represents the volume seller, balancing cost and features.
* Performance: The S trim (191 hp) is significantly slower than the EX/SX trims (281 hp Turbo). The 0-60 mph time for the S trim is approximately 9.0 seconds, compared to roughly 6.5 seconds for the Turbo models.
* Transmission: The S trim's traditional 8-speed automatic is generally smoother in low-speed, stop-and-go traffic than the 8-speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) found in the Turbo models, which can exhibit some "shudder" or hesitation at crawl speeds.
8. Conclusion

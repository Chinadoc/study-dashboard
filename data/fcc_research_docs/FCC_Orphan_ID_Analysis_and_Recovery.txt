Forensic Analysis of Orphan FCC IDs in the AKS Product Catalog: Supply Chain Provenance, Technical Specifications, and Data Recovery Strategies
1. Executive Summary and Strategic Imperative
The integrity of an automotive locksmith catalog is predicated not merely on the volume of its inventory but on the precision of its metadata. In the high-stakes environment of automotive security, where a single incorrect frequency or mismatched part number can result in a "bricked" vehicle module or a failed service call, data accuracy is the currency of trust. This report presents an exhaustive forensic analysis of 16 "orphan" Federal Communications Commission (FCC) identifiers currently residing within the American Key Supply (AKS) product catalog. These identifiers, lacking associated product imagery, represent a latent risk to inventory data hygiene. While they constitute a small fraction of the total database (~2.3% of ~690 IDs), their presence indicates deeper systemic issues regarding data ingestion, legacy supersession management, and the inadvertent inclusion of gray-market regional hardware.
The investigation leverages a triangulation methodology, cross-referencing primary regulatory filings from the FCC’s Office of Engineering and Technology (OET), secondary Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) service literature, and tertiary interoperability data from the global locksmith community. This multi-layered approach allows us to move beyond simple identification and into the realm of provenance reconstruction. We are not simply asking "What is this part?" but "Why is this part here, where did it come from, and does it belong in a US-centric supply chain?"
Our findings fundamentally reshape the initial assumptions regarding manufacturer attribution. The hypothesis that IYZ prefixes belong to General Motors is definitively disproven; these are high-security components from Marquardt GmbH, primarily serving the German luxury sector (Mercedes-Benz and Audi).1 Similarly, the attribution of CWT exclusively to Ford is corrected to Alps Electric, revealing critical cross-pollination with Nissan and Infiniti platforms.3 Perhaps most critically, the analysis uncovers "toxic" data entries, such as HUF5661, which operates on the European 868 MHz spectrum—a frequency illegal for automotive use in the United States—necessitating immediate quarantine protocols to prevent inventory contamination.4
The report categorizes each orphan ID into actionable strategic buckets: Legacy/Discontinued, Active/High-Value, Regional/Gray Market, and Aftermarket/Dealer-Installed. By adopting the recovery strategies outlined herein, AKS can convert these 16 data gaps into a curated, high-integrity subset of the catalog, preventing returns on regional incompatibilities and capturing revenue on high-value modern inventory.


  



2. Regulatory Framework and Data Provenance
To understand why these IDs are "orphaned"—disconnected from their visual and metadata context—one must first understand the regulatory framework that generates them. The FCC ID is not merely a stock keeping unit (SKU); it is a legal certification of radio frequency (RF) compliance.
2.1 The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47
All automotive Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) and Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS) systems sold in the United States must comply with Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, specifically Part 15, which governs unlicensed low-power radiators.6 Manufacturers must submit their devices to independent laboratories for testing to ensure they operate within allowed frequency bands (typically 315 MHz or 433.92 MHz in the US) and do not cause harmful interference.
The resultant "Grant of Equipment Authorization" generates the FCC ID. This ID is immutable. If a manufacturer changes the internal circuitry of a key fob to use a new chip architecture (e.g., moving from a Motorola chip to an NEC chip), they must apply for a new FCC ID, even if the external plastic shell remains identical. This regulatory requirement is the primary engine of "orphan" creation in distributor catalogs:
* Scenario A: A 2008 Mercedes key (FCC ID: IYZ3312) looks identical to a 2006 Mercedes key (FCC ID: IYZ-MS2).
* Scenario B: The distributor has a photo for IYZ3312.
* Scenario C: The distributor ingests a data feed containing the older IYZ-MS2.
* Result: IYZ-MS2 appears as a text-only record (orphan) because the database does not "know" it can share the image of IYZ3312.8
2.2 The Evolution of Grantee Codes
A critical forensic detail lies in the length of the "Grantee Code"—the first segment of the FCC ID.
* Pre-2012 Standard: Grantee codes were restricted to three characters (e.g., LHJ, IYZ, CWT).
* Post-2012 Expansion: Facing exhaustion of available codes, the FCC modified the rules to allow five-character grantee codes (e.g., 2A37U).7
This historical pivot point aids in dating the orphans. The presence of three-character codes like LHJ (Siemens/Continental) and AB0 (GM) immediately flags these items as pre-2012 legacy hardware. Conversely, longer codes or codes with new alphanumeric patterns indicate modern hardware. This distinction is vital for determining whether an orphan is "Too New" (needing a photo) or "Legacy" (needing archival).
2.3 Deconstructing the ID Structure
An FCC ID is composed of two distinct elements, the understanding of which is crucial for correcting the user's manufacturer assumptions:
1. The Grantee Code: The three or five-character prefix assigned permanently to the specific company applying for certification.1 This code identifies the legal entity responsible for the device, not necessarily the vehicle brand it controls.
2. The Product Code: The suffix (up to 14 characters) assigned by the grantee to identifying the specific model.1 Suffixes often contain vital clues about hierarchy, such as -V44 indicating a variant (e.g., Driver 2 memory) of a base model.
3. Analysis Question A2: Forensic Correction of Manufacturer Assumptions
The user's query posits four hypotheses regarding the relationship between FCC prefixes and manufacturers. These assumptions reflect a common conflation between the Tier 1 Supplier (who makes the key) and the OEM (who sells the car). Using the FCC's Grantee Code database, we can definitively correct these mappings.
3.1 Prefix IYZ: The Marquardt Misconception
* User Hypothesis: IYZ prefix = GM/ACDelco?
* Forensic Verdict: INCORRECT.
* Actual Manufacturer: Marquardt GmbH (Rietheim-Weilheim, Germany).2
* Supply Chain Analysis: Marquardt is a premier German switchgear and control systems manufacturer. Their presence in the US automotive market is almost exclusively tied to Mercedes-Benz (the "Chrome Key" era) and Audi (the MLB Evo platform).
* Source of Confusion: While GM does utilize German suppliers (Hella, Continental) for global platforms like the Cadillac CTS (which shared architecture with Opel), Marquardt is not a primary GM supplier for RKE systems. The association of IYZ with GM is a cataloging error likely stemming from a mislabeled entry or a rare cross-platform part. The orphan IDs IYZ-AK2 (Audi) and IYZ-MS2 (Mercedes) confirm the German luxury lineage.12
3.2 Prefix CWTWB: The Alps / Ford Complexity
* User Hypothesis: CWTWB prefix = Ford?
* Forensic Verdict: PARTIALLY CORRECT (Context Required).
* Actual Manufacturer: Alps Electric Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan).3
* Supply Chain Analysis: CWT is the grantee code for Alps. The user is correct that Alps manufactures millions of keys for Ford Motor Company (e.g., the ubiquitous CWTWB1U331 remote). However, treating CWT as a synonym for "Ford" is dangerous. Alps is also the primary supplier for Nissan and Infiniti smart keys.
* Critical Consequence: The orphan ID CWTWBU619 belongs to an Infiniti FX45, not a Ford.14 Identifying this prefix solely as Ford would lead to mis-binning this part in a Ford section, rendering it invisible to locksmiths searching for Nissan parts.
3.3 Prefix MLBHLIK: The Honda Lock Verification
* User Hypothesis: MLBHLIK prefix = Honda?
* Forensic Verdict: CORRECT.
* Actual Manufacturer: Honda Lock Mfg. Co., Ltd. (Miyazaki, Japan).15
* Supply Chain Analysis: Unlike independent Tier 1 suppliers like Continental or Hella, Honda Lock was a subsidiary of Honda Motor Co. (recently merged into MinebeaMitsumi). Their FCC IDs are almost exclusively found on Honda and Acura vehicles.
* Nomenclature: The infix HLIK stands for "Honda Lock Intelligent Key," while HLO stands for "Honda Lock Original." The MLB grantee code is specific to this entity.
3.4 Prefix HUF: The Huf Hülsbeck & Fürst Certainty
* User Hypothesis: HUF prefix = Huf Hülsbeck & Fürst?
* Forensic Verdict: CORRECT.
* Actual Manufacturer: Huf Hülsbeck & Fürst (Velbert, Germany).
* Supply Chain Analysis: Huf is a historic leader in automotive access. They supply the "CAS" (Car Access System) and "FEM" (Front Electronic Module) keys for BMW, as well as systems for Porsche, Rolls Royce, and Mini.
* Technical Note: Huf keys are highly engineered, often featuring complex rolling codes (Hitag Pro) and, critically for this analysis, regional frequency variations that look physically identical but are electronically incompatible.4


  





  



4. Deep Dive Analysis: The "Regional" & "Regulatory" Cohort
Among the orphan IDs, the most technically significant grouping involves those that expose regional frequency incompatibilities. These are not merely missing images; they are potential "inventory time bombs" if sold to the wrong market.
4.1 HUF5661: The 868 MHz Outlier
* FCC ID: HUF5661
* Manufacturer: Huf Hülsbeck & Fürst
* Platform: BMW F-Series (CAS4 / FEM)
* Status: REGIONAL (NON-US) / QUARANTINE
The HUF5661 identifier is the most critical finding in this audit. While it corresponds to a standard-looking BMW "knife style" smart key (used on 3-Series, 5-Series, etc.), detailed analysis of the FCC filing and secondary market listings confirms it operates on 868 MHz.4
The Physics of Incompatibility:
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) allocates radio spectrum globally.
* Region 1 (Europe/Africa/Russia): Uses 433.92 MHz and 868 MHz for automotive RKE. The 868 MHz band is popular in Europe for its range and resistance to interference in dense urban environments.
* Region 2 (Americas): Uses 315 MHz (legacy) and 433.92 MHz (modern).
* The Conflict: In the United States, the 868 MHz band is allocated to industrial/scientific applications and cellular downlinks (LTE Band 5/26 overlap). It is not an authorized band for unlicensed automotive transmitters.
Supply Chain Implication:
A US locksmith attempting to program a HUF5661 key to a US-spec BMW (which expects 315 MHz or 434 MHz) will fail. The vehicle's diversity antenna system is physically tuned to a different wavelength. The key will never register. Its presence in the AKS catalog suggests a "scraping error"—where a database administrator ingested a list of global BMW part numbers without filtering for Region 2 compliance.
Action: This record must be removed or explicitly flagged as "Export Only." It cannot be mapped to a standard US image without a massive warning label.


  



4.2 NBGDM3: The Encryption Barrier
* FCC ID: NBGDM3
* Manufacturer: Hella (Grantee: NBG)
* Platform: Mercedes-Benz FBS4 (Das3 Gen 4)
* Status: OEM-ONLY / RESTRICTED
The NBGDM3 identifier corresponds to the FBS4 generation of Mercedes keys, introduced roughly around 2013-2014.18 This system replaced the widely cracked FBS3 system.
The FBS4 Wall:
Unlike FBS3 keys (IYZ3312), which can be calculated and programmed by high-end aftermarket tools (like Autel, VVDI, CGDI), FBS4 keys employ 128-bit encryption that is largely considered "unbreakable" in the locksmith community. For years, the only way to get a working NBGDM3 key was to order it pre-programmed from a Mercedes dealership using the vehicle's VIN.
Orphan Context:
The absence of an image for NBGDM3 in the AKS catalog is logical: there was historically no market for it. Locksmiths could not buy blank NBGDM3 keys because they couldn't program them. However, recent developments (late 2024/2025) have seen some partial solutions for FBS4 "repair" or "renewal." If AKS intends to sell "Virginized" FBS4 keys, an image is now required. If not, this ID should remain hidden to prevent customers from buying a $150 key they cannot use.
5. Deep Dive Analysis: The "IYZ" Cohort (German Luxury)
This group represents the highest potential revenue density among the orphans. These keys belong to high-value German marques (Audi and Mercedes) where the cost of a replacement key often exceeds $300-$500.
5.1 IYZ-AK2: The Modern Audi Standard
* FCC ID: IYZ-AK2
* Manufacturer: Marquardt GmbH
* Platform: Audi MLB Evo (B9 Chassis and newer)
* Status: TOO-NEW / ACTIVE
This identifier 12 is associated with the current generation of Audi smart keys (2017+), used on the A4, A5, Q5, Q7, and Q8. These keys operate on 433.92 MHz and feature a sleek, high-gloss black or silver design.
Why it's an Orphan:
The "Too New" phenomenon. This key requires specialized diagnostic equipment (ODIS or advanced aftermarket tools like Autel IM608 with G-Box) to program. It has only recently entered the "refurbished/unlocked" market in volume. AKS likely has images for the older "Slot Key" (IYZ-3314) but hasn't yet photographed the newer "Comfort Access" variant.
Recovery: This is a high-priority asset. The key is in high demand. An image of the Audi 4N0 959 754 part family should be acquired immediately.13
5.2 IYZ-MS2 & IYZ-MS5: The Mercedes Legacy
* FCC IDs: IYZ-MS2, IYZ-MS5
* Manufacturer: Marquardt GmbH
* Platform: Mercedes-Benz FBS3 (W203, W211, W220)
* Status: LEGACY / MAP-ABLE
These IDs represent the mid-2000s era of Mercedes "Chrome Keys."
* IYZ-MS2: typically the standard 315 MHz remote.12
* IYZ-MS5: often associated with the Keyless-Go variants of the same era.20
The Supersession Solution: Mercedes is unique in that their key shapes and electronics are backward compatible across nearly 15 years of production. A "Gen 3" chrome key can program to a car that originally came with a "Gen 2" plastic rail key. Therefore, IYZ-MS2 and IYZ-MS5 do not need unique photos. They are visually and functionally identical (for catalog purposes) to the ubiquitous IYZ3312.8 The database strategy here should be mapping, not photographing.
5.3 IYZDC07: The Bread & Butter
* FCC ID: IYZDC07
* Manufacturer: Marquardt GmbH
* Platform: Mercedes C-Class (W204), E-Class (W212)
* Status: ACTIVE
This is simply a variant of the standard FBS3 chrome key.22 The "DC07" suffix likely denotes a specific board revision (NEC chip) compared to older Motorola versions. It is fully cross-compatible with IYZ3312 housings. It should be mapped immediately to the existing IYZ3312 image to clear the orphan status.
6. Deep Dive Analysis: The "Asian & Domestic" Cohort
This cohort reveals the complexity of "Shared Platforms" and "Dealer Installed Options," where the brand on the key doesn't match the brand on the title.
6.1 CWTWBU619: The "Cult Classic" Infiniti Key
* FCC ID: CWTWBU619
* Manufacturer: Alps Electric
* Platform: Infiniti FX35 / FX45 (First Gen)
* Status: ACTIVE / LEGACY
The Infiniti FX series has a dedicated enthusiast following. This key is an Oval-shaped Intelligent Key (Proximity).14 It is often confused with the newer "Guitar Pick" shaped Nissan keys. The ID CWTWBU619 is specific to the older Alps architecture. Recovery: This key is distinct. It cannot be mapped to modern Nissan keys. AKS must locate an image of the Infiniti 3-Button Oval Smart Key (Part # 285E3-CL000).
6.2 MLBHLIK-1TA: The Honda Memory Variant
* FCC ID: MLBHLIK-1TA
* Manufacturer: Honda Lock Mfg.
* Platform: Honda Accord / Civic
* Status: ACTIVE
The "Memory" Suffix:
In the Honda ecosystem, the suffix dictates the driver memory position.
* MLBHLIK-1T = Driver 1 / Base.
* MLBHLIK-1TA = Driver 2 (or specific trunk/hatch config).23
Visual Strategy:
The physical shell of a Driver 1 key is identical to a Driver 2 key. The only difference is the internal transponder ID or a small "2" printed on the back.
Action: Do not photograph a new key. Map this ID to the image for MLBHLIK6-1T and append a textual note: "DRIVER 2 / MEMORY 2 CONFIGURATION."
6.3 KR5V2X-V44: The Modern Honda Memory
* FCC ID: KR5V2X-V44
* Manufacturer: Continental (Grantee: KR5)
* Platform: Honda CR-V, Pilot, Civic (2016+)
* Status: ACTIVE
Identical to the MLB case above. KR5V2X is the base FCC ID for the ubiquitous Honda "5-Button" prox key.25 The -V44 suffix indicates the Driver 2 variant.26 Action: Map to the KR5V2X image. Ensure the catalog title says "Driver 2".
6.4 KBRASTU10: The Nissan Legacy
* FCC ID: KBRASTU10
* Manufacturer: Calsonic Kansei (Grantee: KBR)
* Platform: Nissan Pathfinder, Xterra (2000-2001)
* Status: LEGACY / DISCONTINUED
This is an old-school separate fob (not integrated into the key head).28 It was used for a very short window (2000-2002) before Nissan moved to the standardized Siemens/Continental remotes. Action: Due to the age of the vehicle parc (24+ years), this is a low-priority item. If stock exists, use a generic "Nissan 3-Button Fob" image. If not, consider archiving.
6.5 The Domestic & Dealer-Installed Group
1. G0H-PCGEN2 / GOH-PCGEN2 (Code Alarm):
* Context: These are Dealer Installed remote start systems, often branded "Code Alarm" or "Ford Silver/Gold Remote Start".29 They are not factory line parts.
* The Typo: The duality of G0H (Zero) and GOH (Letter O) is a classic data entry persistence error. The FCC Grantee Code rules usually forbid the numbers "0" and "1" to avoid confusion with letters "O" and "I", but aftermarket companies famously skirt conventions or have older legacy codes.
* Action: Standardize on GOH-PCGEN2. Map to image of "Code Alarm 6-Button Remote."
2. LHJ009 (Saturn):
* Context: Saturn L-Series (2000-2004).31
* Status: DEAD. The brand is gone, the model was low volume, and the car is 20 years old.
* Action: Archive.
3. AB01602T (Cadillac):
* Context: 1996-1999 Cadillac.32
* Status: OBSOLETE. Pre-2000 technology.
* Action: Archive.
4. A2C94464500 (Lincoln):
* Context: Modern Continental Smart Key.6
* Status: ACTIVE. This is the 5-Button "PEPS" fob for the Lincoln Continental (2017+).
* Action: Map to M3N-A2C94464500. Note the "M3N" prefix is often the primary lookup for locksmiths, while "A2C" is the Continental internal part number that often gets cross-listed as an FCC ID.
7. Recovery Recommendations and Strategic Roadmap
The "orphan" status of these 16 FCC IDs is not a singular problem but a symptom of three distinct data hygiene issues: Legacy Obsolescence, Regional Contamination, and Variant Separation.
7.1 Immediate Image Mapping (The "Quick Wins")
The most efficient recovery strategy utilizes existing assets. 60% of the orphans are simply "variants" of keys AKS already images.


  



7.2 Quarantine Protocol (The "Safety Valve")
* HUF5661 (BMW 868 MHz): Must be tagged "NON-US FREQUENCY." If AKS does not export to Europe/Asia, this SKU should be deactivated to prevent returns.
* NBGDM3 (Mercedes FBS4): Tag as "DEALER PROGRAMMING ONLY" or "REQUIRES FBS4 TOOL."
7.3 Acquisition Targets (The "New Revenue")
* IYZ-AK2: Acquire a high-res image of the Audi B9 Gloss Black Smart Key. This is a high-growth SKU.
* CWTWBU619: Acquire an image of the Infiniti FX Oval Smart Key.
8. Conclusion and Required JSON Output
This forensic audit demonstrates that the "Orphan FCC ID" list is a microcosm of the automotive supply chain's complexity. It contains the history of the industry (the transition from Motorola to NEC in Mercedes), the geography of regulation (the 868 MHz divide), and the hierarchy of manufacturing (Alps vs. Ford).
By implementing the mapping strategies outlined above, AKS can resolve the vast majority of these missing images without physical photography, simply by linking "orphan" variant data to "parent" master records. The remaining few require targeted acquisition (Audi) or strategic deletion (Saturn/Legacy), resulting in a leaner, more accurate, and more profitable catalog.

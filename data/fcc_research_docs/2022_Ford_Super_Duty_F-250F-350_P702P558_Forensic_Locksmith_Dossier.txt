2022 Ford Super Duty F-250/F-350 (P702/P558) Forensic Locksmith Dossier
1. Executive Intelligence Summary
1.1 Operational Scope and Strategic Context
The forensic examination of the 2022 Ford Super Duty (F-250, F-350, and chassis cab variants) represents one of the most complex challenges in modern automotive security analysis. This specific model year sits at a turbulent intersection of legacy engineering and next-generation digital architecture. While the industry and even some technical documentation may colloquially refer to the 2021+ Ford truck ecosystem under the umbrella of the P702 platform (which technically designates the 14th generation F-150), the 2022 Super Duty maintains the P558 chassis code (the "Alumiduty" platform introduced in 2017) while aggressively integrating the electronic nervous system of the P702. This hybridization creates a unique "transitional" security environment where traditional locksmithing methodologies often result in catastrophic failure or immobilization, and where forensic artifacts are generated in patterns that differ significantly from both the 2021 predecessors and the 2023 successors.1
This dossier is constructed for the forensic analyst, the advanced security researcher, and the specialized automotive locksmith. It is not merely a procedural guide but a deep-dive investigation into the cryptographic, mechanical, and electronic subsystems that govern access to the vehicle. The objective is to map the entire attack surface—from the physical wafers in the door lock cylinder to the arbitration IDs on the CAN FD bus—and to define the specific signatures left behind by authorized service events versus unauthorized exploitation. The analysis specifically targets the "All Keys Lost" (AKL) scenario, which forces the interaction with the vehicle's most hardened defenses: the Active Alarm state and the Passive Anti-Theft System (PATS) initialization logic.3
Furthermore, this report addresses the pervasive ambiguity surrounding the platform designation. The query's reference to "P702" in the context of a 2022 Super Duty highlights a critical misunderstanding common in the field. The 2022 Super Duty is the final production run of the P558 generation, yet it is electronically distinct from a 2019 or 2020 P558 model due to the infusion of Ford Network Vehicle 2 (FNV2) architecture components, specifically the SYNC 4 interface and the updated Gateway Module (GWM) protocols derived from the P702 F-150 program.2 Understanding this distinction is the prerequisite for selecting the correct digital forensic tools and interpreting the binary data streams extracted from the Body Control Module (BCM).
1.2 The Forensic "Hybrid Zone" Architecture
The 2022 model year serves as a bridge between two distinct eras of Ford engineering. To the casual observer or the uninitiated technician, the vehicle appears identical to the 2017-2021 models. It shares the same aluminum body panels, the same frame rails, and largely the same powertrain options, including the 6.7L PowerStroke V8 diesel. However, the unseen electronic architecture underwent a silent revolution. In preparation for the fully redesigned 2023 "P703" platform, Ford engineers began migrating control modules in the 2022 production run to support the higher data throughput requirements of modern telematics.
This created a forensic "Hybrid Zone." The chassis hardware, including the door latches and physical lock cylinders, largely remains firmly rooted in the P558 specification (using HU101 keyways), while the digital handshake required to authorize a key programming event moved toward the P702's secure diagnostic protocols. This mismatch is the primary source of confusion in the field. A locksmith might successfully mechanically decode the door using a tool designed for a 2017 model, only to find that their OBDII programming tool, which communicates perfectly with a 2020 F-250, fails to even handshake with the 2022 BCM because it lacks the necessary CAN FD (Flexible Data-rate) hardware layer or the updated security access algorithms.5
The implications for forensic analysis are profound. Evidence of a compromised vehicle in this transition year often presents as a mismatch between physical and digital states. For instance, the presence of an HU101 key blade (P558 standard) combined with a BCM log showing communication attempts on the 433 MHz spectrum (P703 standard) would be an immediate red flag indicating component swapping or sophisticated tampering. This dossier will dissect these anomalies, providing the analyst with the granularity needed to distinguish between a legitimate dealer service event and a surreptitious relay attack or illicit programming session.
2. Mechanical Access Control: The Physics of the HU101 and HU198 Interface
The first boundary of the vehicle's security is the physical lock cylinder located on the driver's door. While often overlooked in the age of digital relay attacks, the mechanical lock remains a primary vector for emergency access and forensic evidence collection. The 2022 Super Duty sits at the epicenter of a significant tooling shift between the legacy HU101 profile and the modern HU198 internal track system.
2.1 The HU101 Legacy Architecture
For over a decade, the Ford ecosystem has been defined by the HU101 keyway. This system, developed in conjunction with Volvo and Land Rover during Ford's ownership of those brands, utilizes an "external 2-track" design. In this configuration, the bitting (the coded cut of the key) is milled into the outer edges of the key blade's central web. The wafers inside the lock cylinder interact with these external edges to align at the shear line.
In the 2022 Super Duty, the HU101 remains the dominant standard for the ignition cylinders (on keyed models) and door locks. The physical key blade is rectangular, with a central spine that provides structural rigidity but does not contain coding information. The coding is entirely peripheral. A forensic examination of an HU101 lock cylinder involves inspecting the external contact points of the wafers. When a key is inserted, the ramped cuts on the key blade lift or depress the wafers against spring tension.
The vulnerability of the HU101 system is well-documented. It uses a 10-cut system (positions 1 through 10) with 5 potential depth values (1 being the shallowest cut, leaving the most metal, and 5 being the deepest cut). The lock cylinders are split-tumbler designs, meaning they are susceptible to manipulation via picking tools that can individually actuate the wafers. The Lishi HU101 pick and decoder is the standard tool for this operation. It functions by applying tension to the cylinder plug while a lifting arm manually moves each wafer.
Forensic evidence of Lishi usage on an HU101 lock is distinct. Because the wafers ride on the outside edge of the key, the lifting arm of the pick must also contact the outside edge of the wafer. Under magnification, a picked lock will show vertical scratch marks or "chatter" on the wafer faces that do not align with the smooth, longitudinal wear patterns caused by normal key insertion. These marks are often referred to as "tool marks" in forensic reports and are definitive proof of manipulation.7
2.2 The HU198 "Internal Track" Emergence
Starting around 2017 with smaller platforms like the Fiesta and eventually migrating to the F-150 P702, Ford introduced the HU198 profile. This is an "internal 2-track" or "laser cut" system. The fundamental difference is the location of the bitting. On an HU198 key, the coding is milled into a groove that runs down the center of the key blade face. The outer edges of the key are smooth and uniform, acting only as guides for the keyway.
The 2022 Super Duty presents a forensic hazard here. While the door locks and ignition cylinders are overwhelmingly HU101, researchers have noted that the emergency key blades inserted into the smart fobs (Proximity Keys) for late-2022 production models often utilize an HU198-style blank or a hybrid blank that can be cut for either system.9 This creates a situation where a suspect may possess a key that looks like an internal track key (HU198) but is cut to operate an external track lock (HU101), or vice versa.
The physics of the lock interaction are inverted in the HU198. The wafers in an HU198 cylinder have an internal "nub" or protrusion that rides inside the milled groove of the key. To pick this lock, the tool must reach inside the keyway and pull or push the wafers from their internal contact points. This requires a completely different tool geometry. The Lishi HU198 tool has lifting arms designed to hook into the wafer windows, whereas the HU101 tool has flat lifters designed to push the wafer edges.
Interchangeability and Forensic Risk:
Crucially, the keyway (the hole in the lock plug) for the HU101 and HU198 is often physically similar enough that a key blade from one can be inserted into the other. However, they will not function. An HU101 key inserted into an HU198 lock will slide in, but because it lacks the internal groove, the wafer nubs will simply press against the flat face of the key, and the wafers will not move to the shear line. Conversely, an HU198 key in an HU101 lock will not actuate the wafers because the outer edges are uncut (uncoded).
From a forensic perspective, if a key is found broken off in a lock, or if a suspect is apprehended with a ring of keys, identifying the profile is paramount.
* HU101 Identification: Look for the "snake" pattern cut into the metal edges. The blade cross-section looks like a localized "T" or rectangle with edge modifications.
* HU198 Identification: Look for a continuous milled channel meandering down the flat face of the blade. The edges are straight.
* Hybrid Identification: Some aftermarket blanks are designed to be "universal," with enough metal to be cut on the edge OR milled in the center. Analyzing the cut (edge vs. center) reveals the intended target lock.9
2.3 Destructive Entry Analysis
The aluminum construction of the P558 platform (carried into 2022) introduces specific vulnerabilities to destructive entry. The door skin is aluminum alloy, which has different deformation properties than stamped steel. A common theft vector involves "punching" the lock cylinder—driving a screwdriver or hardened steel tool into the keyway and applying massive torque to force the cylinder to rotate, breaking the internal tumblers or the tailpiece linkage.
In steel doors, the lock cylinder housing is often the failure point. In the aluminum Super Duty doors, the door skin itself often tears or deforms around the handle bucket before the cylinder internals shear. Forensic examination of a recovered vehicle often reveals characteristic tearing or "rippling" of the aluminum around the door handle, distinct from the dents seen on steel doors. This damage pattern is a signature of brute-force attacks on the P558 platform. Additionally, the door latch mechanism inside the panel is shielded by a "jimmy plate" on newer models to prevent slim-jim attacks, but the lock rod is still accessible if the handle assembly is compromised.
3. Electronic Access Control: Radio Frequency and Transponder Protocols
Once physical access is gained, the barrier shifts to the electronic authentication of the key. This occurs via two distinct subsystems: the Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) system for door locks and remote start, and the Passive Anti-Theft System (PATS) for engine immobilization.
3.1 Frequency Spectrum Analysis: The 902 MHz vs. 433 MHz Divide
One of the most definitive forensic markers for distinguishing a late-model P558 (2022) from a P703 (2023+) is the operating frequency of the remote key fobs. This distinction is not merely academic; it dictates the hardware required for interception, cloning, or programming.
The 2017-2022 Super Duty generation operates on a high-frequency band, specifically 902 MHz (often centered at 902.5 MHz). This is relatively unique in the automotive world, where 315 MHz (US standard) and 433 MHz (European/Global standard) are ubiquitous. The move to 902 MHz was driven by the need for longer range for Remote Start features in large trucks and to avoid interference on the crowded lower bands.
* FCC ID Evidence: The primary 5-button smart key (Proximity) for the 2022 model bears the FCC ID: M3N-A2C93142600.11 The standard keyed ignition fob (integrated key head or flip key) often uses M3N-A2C93142300.13
* Forensic Verification: If a spectrum analyzer or frequency counter detects signal bursts at 902 MHz when the suspect fob is pressed, it is consistent with the P558 platform.
In contrast, the 2023+ Super Duty (P703) shifted the architecture to a global standard 433 MHz (specifically 433.92 MHz). The FCC ID for these newer fobs is N5F-A08TBLP.14
* The "False Positive" Trap: An investigator finding a 433 MHz key fob on a 2022 Super Duty should immediately suspect anomalies. While it is theoretically possible (though highly unlikely) that a very late production 2022 was fitted with 2023 receiver modules, the more likely scenario is the presence of an aftermarket remote start bypass module (which often use 433 MHz for long-range LoRa or FSK communication) or a misidentified model year vehicle.


  



3.2 Transponder Cryptography: The ID49 HITAG-PRO Protocol
Embedded within the key fob is the transponder chip, responsible for the PATS immobilization check. The 2022 Super Duty utilizes the ID49 protocol, based on the NXP HITAG-PRO architecture. This represents a significant leap in cryptographic security over the older Texas Crypto (4D-63, 80-bit) chips used in previous Ford generations.
The ID49 chip utilizes 128-bit AES encryption for the challenge-response handshake with the vehicle's immobilizer antenna. This antenna is located in the steering column (for keyed ignition) or in the backup slot in the center console cupholder/media bin (for Push-to-Start vehicles).
* Cloning Impossibility: Unlike the older 40-bit or 80-bit chips, which could be cloned (copied) to a blank emulator chip using handheld tools that sniffed the communication, the ID49 HITAG-PRO protocol employs a "rolling code" and a secret key (SK) that is not easily extracted over the air.
* Programming Requirement: Consequently, generating a working key for a 2022 Super Duty cannot be done by cloning an existing key at a hardware store kiosk. It requires an OBDII programming session where the vehicle's BCM is instructed to learn the unique factory ID of a new, blank transponder. This interaction is a critical forensic checkpoint: every authorized key creation event requires a diagnostic tool to authenticate with the BCM, a process that potentially leaves digital logs.16
3.3 Relay Attack Vulnerabilities (The "Gameboy" Vector)
Despite the robust 128-bit encryption of the transponder, the 2022 Super Duty's "Intelligent Access" (passive entry/start) system is vulnerable to relay attacks. This attack vector targets the convenience feature that allows the car to unlock and start when the key is merely near the vehicle.
Thieves utilize signal amplification devices (often disguised as Gameboys or simple black boxes) to bridge the gap between the key fob (sitting inside the owner's house) and the vehicle (in the driveway). One device is held near the house to pick up the fob's weak beacon, amplifies it, and transmits it to the second device held near the truck door handle. The car "thinks" the key is present and unlocks.
The P558 vs P702 Mitigation Gap:
The 2021+ F-150 (P702 platform) introduced Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology in its key fobs. UWB allows for "Time-of-Flight" calculations—the car measures exactly how long the signal took to travel. If the signal was relayed through amplifiers, the travel time increases (due to processing latency and distance), and the car rejects the command.
Crucially, the 2022 Super Duty (P558 chassis) generally lacks this full UWB implementation. Although it shares some BCM logic with the P702, the transceiver hardware in the 2022 Super Duty is often the legacy RF type. This makes the 2022 model more vulnerable to relay attacks than the 2022 F-150. A forensic investigation of a "mysterious disappearance" theft of a 2022 Super Duty (where no glass was broken and no original keys are missing) should prioritize the relay attack hypothesis over key cloning.
4. The Immobilizer System: Active Alarm and BCM Logic
The core of the forensic locksmith's challenge lies in the Body Control Module (BCM). In the "All Keys Lost" (AKL) scenario, the BCM is the gatekeeper that must be bypassed or negotiated with to authorize a new key.
4.1 The Active Alarm Defense Mechanism
When a 2022 Super Duty is locked with the fob, the Perimeter Alarm is armed. If the vehicle is entered without a valid transponder (e.g., picking the door lock), the alarm triggers. In this Active Alarm state, the BCM enters a defensive lockdown mode.
* Diagnostic Lockout: The BCM monitors the CAN bus for diagnostic requests (specifically Service 0x27 Security Access or Service 0x31 Routine Control). If it detects a tool attempting to initiate key programming while the alarm is sounding, it terminates the communication session immediately. The dashboard may display "Alarm Active" or simply refuse to power up the instrument cluster fully.
* The "Double-Lock" Trap: For forensic analysts, this means that simply gaining physical entry is insufficient. One cannot plug in a tool and program a key while the siren is blaring. The alarm state must be cleared first. Since the analyst does not have a working key (by definition in an AKL case), this creates a paradox: you need a key to silence the alarm to program a key.3
4.2 Bypass Methodologies and Physical Artifacts
To circumvent the Active Alarm lockout, specific physical interventions are required. These interventions leave distinct physical traces that a forensic examiner can identify.
4.2.1 The "Hard Reboot" (Battery Disconnect)
This is the most common field expedient method.
1. Procedure: The technician disconnects the vehicle's negative battery terminal. This cuts power to the BCM.
2. Capacitor Discharge: The system is left disconnected for 60 to 120 seconds to allow internal capacitors in the modules to drain.
3. The Vulnerability Window: When the battery is reconnected, the BCM boots up. There is a finite initialization window (typically 10-30 seconds) where the processor is active and accepting CAN commands, but the alarm software subroutine has not yet fully loaded or re-verified the sensor states.
4. Exploitation: The locksmith must have their programming tool (e.g., Autel IM608, Smart Pro) connected and ready. Immediately upon battery reconnection, they initiate the "Add Key" or "All Keys Lost" function. The tool injects the security seed request before the alarm logic can block it.
* Forensic Artifacts: Look for fresh wrench marks on the battery terminal nuts. Look for "spark marks" or pitting on the battery posts caused by arcing during rapid reconnection. The presence of these marks on a vehicle with low mileage and no service history is a strong indicator of this bypass technique.
4.2.2 The Active Alarm Bypass Cable
For 2021+ architectures (including the P558/P702 hybrid), the timing window of the hard reboot became tighter and less reliable. This necessitated the development of specialized hardware: the Active Alarm Bypass Cable.17
* Mechanism: This cable connects in-line between the vehicle's battery cables and the battery terminals. It contains a physical switch.
* Operation: The tool is connected to the OBDII port. The user flips the switch on the cable, momentarily cutting and restoring power to specific vehicle circuits (effectively performing a controlled, rapid reboot of the BCM) while maintaining a ground reference for the tool. This precise power cycling forces the BCM into a "safe mode" or "pre-alarm" state where diagnostic communication is permitted.
* Forensic Artifacts: Use of this cable often requires manipulating the battery cover and potentially scratching the plastic trim around the battery box. More aggressively, some versions of this attack involve piercing the CAN wires directly if OBD access is restricted, though this is rarer on the Super Duty than on the F-150. A forensic inspection should always check the battery terminal clamps for "alligator clip" bite marks, which are distinct from the uniform pressure marks of the vehicle's own terminal clamps.
4.3 BCM Data Logging and "Incode/Outcode"
The BCM controls the PATS logic using a Challenge-Response mechanism.
1. Outcode: The BCM generates a random hexadecimal string (the Challenge) when a programming request is made.
2. Incode: The programming tool must calculate the correct mathematical response (the Key) and send it back.
3. Authorization: If the Incode matches, the BCM grants "Security Level 1" access, allowing the writing of key IDs to the EEPROM.
On the 2022 Super Duty, this calculation is 24-digit or higher complexity, far exceeding the old 4-digit codes.
* FDRS Trace: If a dealer tool (FDRS) is used, the Outcode is sent to Ford's servers, the Incode is calculated by the server, and the transaction is logged against the VIN.
* Aftermarket Trace: Aftermarket tools (Autel, Smart Pro, FKTS) typically use a third-party server or a localized brute-force algorithm to derive the Incode. These events are not logged in Ford's central warranty database. Therefore, a forensic check of the vehicle's history report may show "No Key Service," yet the vehicle has a new key. This discrepancy proves the use of aftermarket/illicit tools.


  



5. The Diesel Specificity: 6.7L PowerStroke Glow Plug Interference
A subset of the 2022 Super Duty population—the diesel F-250/F-350 models equipped with the 6.7L PowerStroke engine—presents a unique, non-cryptographic barrier to forensic key programming. This issue is physical and electrical in nature but manifests as a digital failure.19
5.1 The EMI/Voltage Drop Phenomenon
The Glow Plug Control Module (GPCM) on the 6.7L engine is a high-current device designed to rapidly heat the ceramic glow plugs to 1,250°C within 2 seconds to facilitate combustion.
* The Trigger: When the ignition is cycled to the "ON" position (a mandatory step during key programming to wake up the BCM), the GPCM automatically energizes the glow plugs.
* The Draw: This event draws a massive current surge (up to 100+ Amps initially) from the battery.
* The Interference: This surge creates two distinct problems:
   1. Voltage Drop: System voltage can momentarily plunge below 11.5V. The BCM and the programming tool require a stable voltage (ideally >12.5V) to maintain the programming session. If the voltage sags, the BCM may reset or abort the EEPROM write process to protect data integrity.21
   2. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI): The rapid switching of high current creates electrical noise on the vehicle's ground plane and power distribution network. Since the CAN bus relies on differential voltage signaling, excessive noise can corrupt the data packets being exchanged between the tool and the BCM.
5.2 Forensic Indicators of GPCM Interference
When this interference occurs, the programming tool typically errors out with generic messages like "Communication Failed," "Security Access Denied," or "Programming Failed." The technician (or thief) must mitigate this to succeed.
The standard mitigation leaves clear forensic evidence:
1. GPCM Disconnection: The most effective workaround is to physically unplug the GPCM connectors. The GPCM is located on the top of the engine, usually on the passenger side valve cover area.
   * Trace: A forensic inspection of the engine bay should check the GPCM connectors. Are the locking tabs broken? is there dust disturbed around the connector housing? Is the connector currently unseated? If a vehicle is found running but with the GPCM disconnected, it strongly suggests a very recent key programming event where the operator forgot to reconnect it.
2. Battery Support: Professional locksmiths use high-amperage (50-100 Amp) battery maintainers to buffer the voltage drop. The absence of a maintainer during a programming attempt on a diesel 2022 Super Duty is a primary cause of failure.
5.3 Technical Schematic of the Failure Mode
Ideally, the BCM communicates with the OBDII tool via the HS-CAN bus. The GPCM is also on a network (often a different powertrain sub-network or shared power/ground).
* Normal State: The CAN High (2.5V +) and CAN Low (2.5V -) lines carry clean square-wave data.
* Interference State: The GPCM activation causes "ground bounce" (fluctuation in the 0V reference). This shifts the baseline voltage of the entire system. The CAN transceivers in the BCM may misinterpret a logic "0" as a logic "1" or vice versa due to this reference shift, leading to checksum errors in the security packet. The BCM's error-handling logic detects the corrupted packet and defaults to a "Access Denied" state to prevent hacking.
6. The Digital Toolchain: CAN FD and Diagnostics
The 2022 Super Duty's "Hybrid Zone" status is most evident in its diagnostic protocols.
6.1 CAN FD (Flexible Data-rate) Requirement
The P702 influence on the 2022 Super Duty BCM introduced CAN FD capability. While the vehicle may still conduct some operations on standard High-Speed CAN (500 kbps), the diagnostic gateway often negotiates at CAN FD speeds (2 Mbps or higher) for large data transfers, such as module flashing or complex authorization sequences.
* Tool Incompatibility: Legacy J2534 interfaces (like the older Ford VCM II) or first-generation key programmers (like the Autel IM608 without the upgraded JVCI or CAN FD adapter) cannot read the CAN FD frames. They will see the bus as "silent" or "garbled."
* The Adapter: To program a 2022 Super Duty, a forensic locksmith must use a tool with a CAN FD transceiver. For Autel users, this means using the CAN FD Adapter (a small OBD dongle) or the newer V200 interface.5
* Forensic Note: If a suspect claims to have programmed the key using an old tool without a CAN FD adapter, their testimony is technically invalid for a 2022 model. This is a useful interrogation or verification point.
6.2 Tool Ecosystem Analysis
Three primary categories of tools are observed in this domain:
1. OEM (FDRS): Ford Diagnostic & Repair System. Requires NASTF credentials. Logs everything to the cloud. The "Gold Standard" for authorized repair but leaves the biggest trail.
2. Professional Aftermarket (Autel / Smart Pro): High-end tablets. They reverse-engineer the seeds. They are capable of bypassing the need for NASTF by using offshore calculation servers. They support the "Active Alarm Bypass" macros and CAN FD protocols.
3. Grey Market / Niche (FKTS): The "FKTS" tool mentioned in research 23 appears to be a specialized software solution tailored for the Ford ecosystem. It likely bypasses standard security checks by exploiting specific vulnerabilities in the BCM firmware or by using a proprietary incode calculator. The existence of such tools indicates a sophisticated market for "fast" Ford programming that avoids the time-consuming/expensive official channels.
7. Fleet Variations: F-350 Chassis Cab and F-550
The "Chassis Cab" models (F-350 CC, F-450, F-550) are often deployed in commercial fleets and differ slightly from the retail "Pickup" (F-250/F-350) models.
7.1 Upfitter Switch Interference
These vehicles are equipped with Upfitter Switches connected to a relay box and the BCM to control aftermarket equipment (lights, PTOs, cranes).
* The Risk: Poor wiring by third-party upfitters can introduce noise onto the CAN bus similar to the Glow Plug issue. If an upfitter has tapped into the CAN lines (to read vehicle speed for a PTO, for example) without proper isolation, it can disrupt the delicate timing of the key programming sequence.25
* Forensic Protocol: On chassis cab models, the investigator must inspect the Upfitter Interface Module (UIM) connections (usually behind the glovebox or kick panel). Unauthorized or sloppy taps here are a frequent cause of "unprogrammable" vehicles.
7.2 Speed Limiters and MyKey
Fleet vehicles often have the MyKey feature active, which limits top speed and radio volume.
* Programming Override: In an AKL scenario on a fleet vehicle, the locksmith must program an "Admin Key" (Master Key) to override these restrictions. If a key is programmed as a "MyKey" (Restricted Key) by mistake, the vehicle will remain speed-limited.
* Reset: Resetting the MyKey status requires two unique Admin Keys to be present in the vehicle. This "two-key" rule is hard-coded in the BCM for MyKey administration.
8. Conclusion
The 2022 Ford Super Duty F-250/F-350 is a forensic anomaly. It is a P558 chassis wearing the digital clothing of a P702. This duality defines every aspect of its security profile.
For the forensic locksmith, the successful analysis or recovery of this vehicle requires a multi-layered approach:
1. Mechanical: Verifying the keyway profile (HU101 vs HU198) to identify the lock generation.
2. Electrical: Managing the harsh EMI environment of the 6.7L diesel and the Active Alarm state.
3. Digital: utilizing CAN FD-capable hardware to bridge the communication gap with the updated BCM.
Any investigation into unauthorized access must look for the subtle artifacts of this struggle: the scratch marks on the battery terminals from a bypass cable, the disconnected GPCM connectors from a diesel noise mitigation, or the presence of a 902 MHz key fob in a market shifting toward 433 MHz. These are the silent witnesses in the complex interaction between the locksmith, the thief, and the machine.

The Apex of Security: A Comprehensive Locksmith Guide for the 2021+ Audi Q7 (4M) & Q8 Facelift
Executive Summary
The automotive security landscape is in a state of perpetual escalation, a technological arms race between manufacturers seeking to secure their assets and the aftermarket professionals tasked with servicing them. The 2021+ Audi Q7 (internal chassis designation 4M Facelift) and its coupe-styled counterpart, the Q8, stand at the very pinnacle of this conflict within the Volkswagen Group's hierarchy. These vehicles represent the mature implementation of the MLB Evo platform's security architecture, a system that has evolved significantly from the relatively permissive immobilizers of the early 2010s.
For the professional locksmith, the 2021+ Q7 and Q8 are not merely "new cars"; they are hostile environments. They introduce a convergence of three distinct but interlocking security technologies: the "Locked" BCM2 module featuring encrypted NEC processors that resist traditional reading methods; the distributed Component Security (CS) framework that requires synchronization data from multiple control units for total system authority; and the SFD (Schutz Fahrzeug Diagnose) firewall, a cloud-based gatekeeper that actively blocks unauthorized diagnostic communication.
This research report serves as a definitive, field-ready manual for the advanced automotive locksmith. It moves beyond simple procedural checklists to provide a rigorous technical analysis of the underlying cryptographic mechanisms at play. It distinguishes between the achievable task of adding a key—which can often be performed via dealer-level emulation or direct hardware interfacing—and the formidable challenge of an "All Keys Lost" (AKL) scenario, which necessitates a deep understanding of data synchronization across the vehicle's controller area network. Furthermore, this guide clarifies the critical, often expensive, distinctions between regional frequency allocations (315MHz vs. 433MHz) and provides the first exhaustive open-source breakdown of the HU162T "10-cut" mechanical lock system, a mechanism that requires a fundamental rethinking of traditional lock manipulation strategies.
The following analysis confirms that while dealer tools (ODIS) remain the path of least resistance and highest reliability, the aftermarket has developed robust, albeit complex, solutions involving solder-free memory extraction and third-party data calculation. This report details those workflows, exposing the severe risks of BCM2 corruption and outlining the precise methodology required to navigate the "Sync Data" hurdle that defines modern Audi security.

1. Security Architecture & Platform Analysis
1.1 The MLB Evo Platform: A Longitudinal Fortress
To understand the security logic of the 2021+ Audi Q7 and Q8, one must first understand the physical and digital architecture of the vehicle itself. These models are built on the MLB Evo (Modularer Längsbaukasten Evolution) platform.1 This distinction is paramount because it dictates the location and hierarchy of the immobilizer components.
Unlike the MQB (Modularer Querbaukasten) platform used by Volkswagen's transverse-engine vehicles (like the Golf, Tiguan, or Audi A3), where the instrument cluster often plays a central role in the immobilizer chain, the MLB Evo platform relies on a longitudinal engine orientation. In this architecture, the hierarchy of trust is centered elsewhere. The Body Control Module 2 (BCM2), physically located in the rear luggage compartment, serves as the undisputed "IMMO Master".4
The instrument cluster in the Q7/Q8, while a sophisticated piece of digital cockpit technology, is largely a slave unit in the context of key authorization. It displays messages ("Key not found," "Safe"), but it does not hold the master cryptographic keys required to generate a new dealer key. This architectural decision creates a specific workflow for locksmiths: attacks or service procedures focused on the dashboard are futile. All efforts must be directed toward the rear of the vehicle, where the BCM2 resides, and toward the powertrain modules that hold the verifying secrets.


  



1.2 IMMO Generation: The Era of the "Locked" BCM2
The security system employed in the 2021+ Q7 and Q8 is technically classified as a late-stage variant of IMMO 5 (Generation 5). While the fundamental logic of Component Security (CS) remains consistent with earlier IMMO 5 iterations, the hardware implementing it has undergone a drastic hardening process.
Around 2013-2014, Audi began a transition that was fully cemented by the time the Q7 facelift arrived in 2020/2021. The BCM2 modules shifted from using "open" NEC microcontrollers to Locked NEC processors (specifically chips like the D70F3634 and D70F3381).6
The term "Locked" is not merely a marketing designation; it refers to a specific hardware state where the debug port (JTAG/SWD) on the microcontroller has been disabled by the manufacturer. In earlier generations, a locksmith could clip a programmer onto the chip and read the EEPROM data directly. In the 2021+ Q7, attempting to read these chips using standard protocols will result in immediate failure or, in the hands of inexperienced technicians using aggressive voltage glitching techniques, the corruption of the P-FLASH (Program Flash).4
The memory architecture of these modules is bifurcated:
1. P-FLASH (Program Flash): This sector contains the operating system and executable code of the BCM2. It essentially tells the module how to be a BCM.
2. D-FLASH (Data Flash): This is the critical sector for the locksmith. It emulates the function of an EEPROM, storing the specific variables that define the vehicle's identity: the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), the Component Security (CS) bytes, the authorized Key IDs, and the remote control rolling codes.
For 2021+ models, accessing the D-FLASH is the primary technical hurdle. Because the processor is locked, the industry has had to develop specialized adapters (like the Xhorse BCM2 Adapter or Autel APB131) that utilize proprietary exploit vectors to bypass the lock without physically soldering wires to the board, thereby reducing the risk of thermal damage or data loss.4
1.3 Component Security (CS) and the "Sync Data" Barrier
The defining characteristic of IMMO 5, and specifically the implementation in the MLB Evo platform, is the Component Security (CS) protocol. In previous generations (IMMO 4), the authorization code was a relatively static entity. In the modern MLB Evo environment, the CS is a composite, distributed key.
The most critical concept for the 2021+ Q7/Q8 is the 32-Byte Synchronization Data. In older systems, gaining access to the BCM2 data was sufficient to generate a "Dealer Key" that would start the car. This is no longer true for "All Keys Lost" scenarios on the 2021+ platform. The BCM2 does not hold the entirety of the trust chain in a readable format. It relies on a synchronization string that validates its relationship with the Engine Control Unit (ECU) and the Transmission Control Unit (TCU).7
This has profound implications for the locksmith:
* Add-a-Key Scenario: If a working key is present, the diagnostic tool can essentially "ask" the key for its credentials. The key itself provides the necessary authorization to decrypt the BCM2 data. The Sync Data is effectively bridged by the valid key.
* All Keys Lost (AKL) Scenario: With no key to provide the decryption bridge, the locksmith is locked out of the BCM2's deeper security functions. To generate a key that will actually crank the engine, the technician must retrieve the 32-byte Sync Data from another source. Since the BCM2 is encrypted, the only remaining sources are the ECU or TCU. This forces the locksmith to perform complex bench reading operations on the engine or transmission computers to extract the sync bytes, which must then be combined with the BCM2 data by a third-party calculation server to synthesize a valid Dealer Key.11
________________
2. Key Identification: FCC IDs, Frequencies, and Part Numbers
A significant percentage of failures in servicing 2021+ Audi vehicles stem not from programming errors, but from inventory errors. The keys for the 2021+ Q7 and Q8 are visually indistinguishable from earlier "Smart Key" fobs used on the 2017-2019 models, yet they often contain updated firmware or different frequency modulations that render them incompatible.
2.1 The 315MHz vs. 433MHz Trap
For decades, a general rule of thumb in the locksmith industry was that "German cars use 433MHz, and US cars use 315MHz." While this remains largely true for the Q7/Q8, the globalization of parts has created edge cases and confusion in the aftermarket supply chain.
* US Market: The 2021+ Q7 and Q8 sold in the United States and Canada predominantly operate on 315MHz.12
* European/ROW Market: Vehicles sold in Europe, Asia, and other "Rest of World" markets almost exclusively use 433MHz (sometimes precisely 433.92MHz or 434MHz).15
* The Risk: Many aftermarket suppliers on platforms like eBay or AliExpress will list keys as "Dual Frequency" or simply copy-paste compatibility lists that merge US and EU models. This is false. An OEM Audi key is hard-coded to a specific frequency. Attempting to program a 433MHz key to a 315MHz US vehicle will result in a "Key Learning Failed" error, or worse, the key might program to the immobilizer (starting the car via the emergency coil) but the remote buttons and proximity features will never function because the antenna hardware in the vehicle is tuned to a different wavelength.17
2.2 Valid FCC IDs and Part Numbers
To ensure success, the locksmith must verify the FCC ID printed on the side of the original key (if available) or order strictly by VIN-verified part numbers.
USA / North American Market (315 MHz):
* FCC ID: NBGFS14P71
* Core Part Numbers:
   * 4M0 959 754 CM 19: This is the primary part number for 2021+ facelift models.
   * 4M0 959 754 DB 20: An alternative suffix, often found on later production runs or specific trim levels.
* Transponder: Megamos AES (often ID88 or similar advanced crypto).
European / International Market (433 MHz):
* FCC ID: IYZ-AK01
* Core Part Numbers:
   * 4M0 959 754 AK 15: The standard European key.
   * 4M0 959 754 AQ: A variation often associated with specific comfort access features.
   * 4M0 959 754 AF: Another common European variant.
Critical Warning: If you are servicing a vehicle in the US, finding a key with the suffix "AK" or "AQ" should be an immediate red flag. These are European keys and will almost certainly fail to provide full functionality. Conversely, a European locksmith encountering a "CM" key is looking at a US-spec import.
2.3 "Comfort" vs. Standard Keys
The 2021+ Q7/Q8 is a luxury platform, and as such, "Comfort Access" (Audi's term for Keyless Go/Proximity Entry) is standard on nearly all trims. However, lower-tier replacement keys exist in the aftermarket.
* The Technology: Comfort keys contain active LF (Low Frequency) transceivers that constantly listen for the car's wake-up signal. When you touch the door handle, the car pings the key, and the key responds.
* The Compatibility Issue: If you attempt to program a "Standard" (non-prox) key to a vehicle equipped with Kessy (Keyless Entry Start System), the vehicle may accept the key for ignition start (via the emergency coil) but will ignore it for passive entry. The customer will be forced to press the buttons to unlock the car and place the key in the cupholder to start it—a significant downgrade in user experience. Always ensure replacement stock is explicitly labeled for "Keyless Go" or "Proximity".1
________________
3. Tooling Prerequisites
Servicing a 2021+ Q7/Q8 is not possible with basic OBD programmers. The level of encryption and the need for server-side calculation necessitate a specific tier of equipment.
3.1 Dealer-Level: ODIS (Offboard Diagnostic Information System)
The "Gold Standard" for Audi service is the factory tool, ODIS.
* Hardware: Requires a VAS6154 diagnostic interface or a high-quality J2534 passthrough device (like the Autel MaxiFlash or Cardaq).
* Access: Mere possession of the software is insufficient. Key programming requires a live connection to the VAG servers in Germany. This necessitates a valid GeKo (Geheimniß und Komponentenschutz) user ID with Component Security access rights.23
* Pros: It is the only method guaranteed to work on the absolute newest firmware versions. It handles the SFD unlock process natively and retains the factory warranty.
* Cons: It is expensive (subscription + per-use fees), requires rigorous vetting to obtain GeKo credentials (often restricted to registered businesses), and is completely dependent on internet connectivity.
3.2 Aftermarket: The "Big Three" Ecosystems
For independent locksmiths, three major ecosystems have developed viable solutions for the MLB Evo platform.
1. Xhorse (VVDI Key Tool Plus / VVDI2):
   * Hardware: The Key Tool Plus Pad is the flagship all-in-one unit. Alternatively, a VVDI2 connected to a laptop can be used.
   * Crucial Add-on: The Xhorse BCM2 Solder-Free Adapter Kit is non-negotiable.4 This kit includes specialized interface boards that clamp onto the BCM2's pins, allowing the tool to read the encrypted data without soldering.
   * Strengths: Xhorse is widely regarded for its robust BCM2 reading capabilities and frequent updates for VAG group vehicles.
2. Autel (MaxiIM IM608 Pro / IM508S):
   * Hardware: The IM608 Pro (or IM608 II) is the standard.
   * Crucial Add-on: The XP400 Pro programmer is required, along with the APB131 Adapter specifically designed for Audi BCM2 reading.26
   * Strengths: Autel's "Expert Mode" provides excellent guided functions. The tool can often calculate IMMO data via its own server network, simplifying the process for the user.
3. Yanhua ACDP:
   * Hardware: The ACDP Master (Module 1 or 2).
   * Crucial Add-on: Module 29 (Audi Gen5 BCM2).6
   * Strengths: Yanhua specializes in "no-solder" solutions. Their interface boards bolt securely onto the BCM2, using pogo pins to make contact with test points. This is often the safest method for the hardware, minimizing the risk of knocking off tiny resistors or overheating components.

4. Key Programming Procedures
4.1 Operational Workflow: The Decision Tree
Unlike older vehicles where the process was linear, the 2021+ Q7 requires a branched decision-making process. The locksmith cannot simply "plug and play." The operational workflow is determined by the state of the vehicle (Add Key vs. All Keys Lost) and the encryption status of the BCM2.
The Workflow Logic:
1. Initial Check: Connect the diagnostic tool via OBD. Attempt to "Read IMMO Data."
2. Encryption Verification: The tool will query the BCM2. If the BCM2 is an older, unencrypted version (rare on 2021+), it will proceed via OBD.
3. The Lockout: On nearly all 2021+ Q7/Q8 models, the tool will report that the BCM2 is "Locked" or "Encrypted." It will instruct the user to disconnect the module.
4. Bench Intervention: The workflow mandates the removal of the BCM2 from the vehicle.
5. Data Extraction: Using the specific adapter (Xhorse/Autel/Yanhua), the locksmith reads the D-FLASH and P-FLASH on the bench.
6. Reassembly & Programming: The BCM2 is reinstalled. The tool then uses the extracted data to prepare a "Dealer Key" and subsequently learn it to the car.
4.2 Scenario A: Add-a-Key (Working Key Present)
Difficulty: High | Risk: Moderate
This is the preferred and safest method. The presence of a working key provides the "Authorization Token" needed to decrypt the BCM2's data without needing to fetch external Sync Data.
Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. Voltage Stabilization: Connect a high-quality battery maintainer (e.g., Midtronics or Victron) set to 13.5V. Do not rely on a simple jump pack. Voltage fluctuations during BCM2 reading/writing can corrupt the flash memory, bricking the module.28
2. Diagnostic Connection: Connect the programmer (e.g., Autel IM608) to the OBD port. Navigate to IMMO > Audi > Q7 (2021+) > Control Unit > Key Learning.
3. Attempt OBD Read: Select "Read IMMO Data." The tool will identify the BCM2 version. It will likely prompt that the version requires bench reading.
4. BCM2 Removal:
   * Disconnect the vehicle's negative battery terminal to prevent short circuits.
   * Access the BCM2 in the rear luggage compartment (typically behind the left or right side trim panel, depending on the region/configuration).29
   * Unlock the connectors and remove the module.
5. Bench Connection:
   * Attach the specific solder-free adapter (e.g., APB131 for Autel) to the BCM2 board. Verify that all pogo pins are seated correctly on the test points.
   * Connect the adapter to the programmer (XP400 Pro/Key Tool Plus).
6. Read & Save Data: Execute the "Read D-FLASH" and "Read P-FLASH" functions. Crucial: Save these files immediately to the tablet and back them up to a cloud or USB drive. This is your insurance policy.
7. Decryption: The tool will prompt you to load the D-FLASH file. It will then ask for the "Working Key." Place the original key in the programmer's coil. The tool reads the key's ID and crypto keys to decrypt the BCM2 dump.
8. Dealer Key Generation:
   * Select "Make Dealer Key."
   * Place the new, blank key in the programmer coil.
   * The tool writes the encrypted Component Security data to the new key, effectively "marrying" it to the vehicle's identity.
9. Key Learning:
   * Reinstall the BCM2 in the vehicle. Reconnect the battery.
   * Return to the OBD menu and select "Learn Key."
   * The dashboard will display "Learning Mode" or "1 of 2 Keys Learned."
   * Place the original key on the emergency start coil (usually marked with a key/radio symbol in the cupholder or dash). Hold it there until the hazards flash or the dash beeps.
   * Place the new key on the coil. Wait for confirmation.
10. Verification: Test all buttons, proximity entry, and remote start (if equipped).
4.3 Scenario B: All Keys Lost (AKL) - The "Sync Data" Challenge
Difficulty: Extreme | Risk: High
In an "All Keys Lost" situation, the locksmith faces a massive hurdle: the BCM2 is encrypted, and there is no working key to provide the decryption key. While the BCM2 D-FLASH can still be read on the bench, the data extracted is incomplete for the purpose of starting the engine. It lacks the validity check that the engine computer requires.
To surmount this, the locksmith must obtain the 32-byte Synchronization Data.
The Procedure:
1. Read BCM2: Follow the same steps as above to remove and read the BCM2 D-FLASH and P-FLASH on the bench.
2. The "Sync Data" Prompt: When you attempt to "Make Dealer Key" in an AKL scenario, the tool (Autel/Xhorse) will stop and request the Sync Data. It cannot calculate this from the BCM2 dump alone.
3. Extraction of Sync Data (The Hard Part):
   * Method A (Dealer/ODIS): This is the official path. You order a "Pre-coded" key from the dealer using the VIN. This key comes from the factory with the CS and Sync Data already written. You then use ODIS to learn it. This takes days or weeks.
   * Method B (Bench Read of ECU/TCU): This is the aftermarket path. You must physically remove the Engine Control Unit (ECU) and/or the Transmission Control Unit (TCU) from the vehicle.
   * Using a dedicated ECU programming tool (like VVDI Prog, Magicmotorsport Flex, Autel G-Box, or K-Tag), you must read the EEPROM and Flash memory of the ECU/TCU on the bench.30 This often requires opening the ECU or connecting to specific boot pins on the connector.
4. Third-Party Calculation:
   * The locksmith now possesses three data sets: BCM2 Dump, ECU Dump, and/or TCU Dump.
   * These files must be sent to a specialized calculation service. Providers like PolDiag (which sells specific licenses for this 10) or various "VAG Helper" services online can analyze these files.
   * The service extracts the elusive 32-byte Sync String that links the BCM2 to the engine.
5. Synthesis:
   * The locksmith manually inputs this 32-byte string into the Autel/Xhorse tool during the "Make Dealer Key" process.
   * The tool combines the BCM2 data with the Sync Data to create a valid Dealer Key.
6. Programming: With a valid Dealer Key now created, the locksmith proceeds to the "Key Learning" phase in the car, effectively teaching the BCM2 to accept the new key.

5. The Mechanical Interface: HU162T "10-Cut" Analysis
The 2021+ Audi Q7 abandons the long-standing HU66 keyway for the HU162T, a high-security, side-milled laser key system that presents its own set of challenges.
5.1 Identification: The "10-Cut" Architecture
A common point of confusion is the existence of "9-Cut" and "10-Cut" versions of the HU162T.
* 9-Cut: Primarily found on Volkswagen models (Golf, Jetta) and some lower-tier Audis.
* 10-Cut: The standard for the 2021+ Q7 and Q8.33
The Geometry:
The "10-Cut" system (sometimes noted as "6+4") features:
1. 6 Main Cuts: These are the traditional "worm" or "laser" tracks cut into the flat face of the key blade.
2. 4 Side Cuts: These are critical. They are cut into the narrow edge of the key blade near the shoulder. These cuts interact with a spring-loaded sidebar inside the lock cylinder. Unlike traditional tumblers which move up and down, the sidebar must be depressed into the plug to allow rotation.
5.2 Lishi Tool Strategy
Attempting to pick or decode a 2021+ Q7 with a standard HU162T (9-Cut) Lishi tool will fail. The spacing for the side cuts is different.
* Required Tool: Lishi HU162T (10-Cut).35
* Picking Technique: The sidebar adds a secondary locking mechanism.
   1. Sidebar First: Many locksmiths find success by applying tension and picking the side pins (the 4 edge cuts) before attacking the main track. The side pins often feel "springy" but must be set to release the sidebar pressure.
   2. Main Track: Once the sidebar is set (indicated by a slight rotation of the plug or a change in tension feel), the 6 main wafers can be picked.
* Decoding: The Lishi tool has a specialized grid. You must read the depths of the 6 main cuts and the 4 side cuts independently.
* Cutting: When inputting the code into a key cutting machine (like the Xhorse Dolphin XP-005 or Condor), ensure you select the HU162T-10 profile. The machine may prompt you to rotate the key in the jaw (using a specialized clamp or shim) to cut the edge bitting.
5.3 Emergency Access
The door lock cylinder on the Q7/Q8 is concealed for aesthetic reasons.
* Location: It is hidden under a plastic cap on the driver's door handle.
* Removal: Pull the door handle to the open position. Look for a small slot on the underside of the decorative cap. Insert the tip of the emergency key (or a small hook tool) into this slot and gently pry the cap outward while maintaining the handle in the open position. The cylinder is then accessible.
________________
6. Diagnostic Protocols & SFD: The Digital Firewall
The SFD (Schutz Fahrzeug Diagnose / Vehicle Diagnostic Protection) is a layer of security introduced by the Volkswagen Group for MQB Evo and MLB Evo vehicles (2020+). It acts as a firewall against unauthorized coding and adaptations.
6.1 Understanding SFD
In older vehicles, a locksmith could simply connect a tool and start clearing codes or adapting modules. On a 2021+ Q7, attempting to access the BCM2 or Gateway (Module 19) to perform sensitive operations will result in a "Security Access Denied" message. The vehicle effectively says, "I see you, but I don't trust you."
6.2 Overcoming SFD
To program keys or perform adaptations (like fixing the ELV), you must unlock SFD.
* The Token System: SFD uses a challenge-response system. The diagnostic tool reads a challenge string from the car, sends it to a server, and receives a signed token to unlock the module for 90 minutes.
* ODIS Method: With a GeKo account, ODIS handles this transparently in the background.
* Aftermarket Method:
   * Autel/Xhorse: Advanced tools like the IM608 have integrated SFD unlocking capabilities in their latest software updates. When the tool encounters an SFD lock, it will prompt the user to "Unlock." Crucial: The tablet must be connected to the internet to fetch the token from Autel/Xhorse's servers.37
   * Manual Token Generation: If the key programmer cannot unlock SFD automatically, the locksmith may need to use a separate tool like OBDeleven (PRO subscription required) or Carista to unlock the Gateway and BCM2 before connecting the key programmer.38
________________
7. Critical "Gotchas" & Risk Management
Working on a 2021+ Q7 is a high-stakes operation. A single error can render the vehicle immovable, leading to thousands of dollars in repair costs.
7.1 The "Death Code" 02811 (ELV Failure)
The most feared outcome for an Audi locksmith is the 02811 error code.
* The DTC: 02811 - Control Module for Electronic Steering Column Lock (J764) - Defective.28
* The Mechanism: The Electronic Steering Column Lock (ELV) is tightly synchronized with the BCM2. If the battery voltage drops during the BCM2 read/write process, or if the BCM2 data is corrupted during decryption, the ELV may lose its synchronization or flag an internal defect.
* The Consequence: The vehicle enters a "Safe" mode. It will not crank. The ignition cannot be turned on (Terminal 15 is dead).
* The Fix: In many cases, this is not a simple "clear code" fix. It often requires ODIS to perform a "Steering Lock Adaptation" or complete replacement of the steering column. Some aftermarket tools (like PolDiag) claim an "ELV Repair" or "ELV Off" function via OBD, but these are risky and not guaranteed.32
* Prevention: Voltage maintenance is critical. Never attempt BCM2 work without a stable 13.5V power supply connected.
7.2 The "00003" Module Defect
Another risk of improper BCM2 manipulation is the 00003 - Control Module - Defective error.41
* Cause: This usually indicates a checksum error in the EEPROM/D-FLASH data, often caused by a bad write or an interrupted flash procedure.
* Solution: Restoring the BCM2 from the original backup (read in Step 6 of the workflow) usually resolves this. This highlights the absolute necessity of saving both D-FLASH and P-FLASH before attempting any write operations.
7.3 Inventory Mishaps
Using the wrong key part number is a silent failure.
* Scenario: A locksmith programs a European 4M0 959 754 AK key to a US-market Q7.
* Outcome: The key might learn to the immobilizer because the Megamos AES chip is compatible. The car will start when the key is on the emergency coil. However, the remote buttons will not work, and the proximity (Keyless Go) features will fail. The customer will be left with a semi-functional key, and the locksmith will have wasted a valuable OEM key shell that cannot be unlocked easily. Always verify the FCC ID (NBGFS14P71 for US).
________________
8. Battery & Component Locations
* Key Fob Battery: CR2032.12
* Emergency Start Coil:
   * Q7 (4M): The coil location can vary. It is typically marked with a key/radio symbol. Look in the front cup holder or on the dashboard panel to the left of the steering wheel.
   * Q8: Almost exclusively located in the center console cupholder area. Look for the rubber mat with the "key" icon.43
* Vehicle Battery:
   * The main 12V battery is typically located under the front passenger floor mat or in the trunk/cargo area.
   * Hybrid Warning: 2021+ models almost always feature a 48V Mild Hybrid (MHEV) system. Do not disconnect the 48V Lithium-ion battery unless you are specifically trained and wearing high-voltage PPE. Connect your battery maintainer/charger strictly to the 12V jump posts under the hood.44
________________
9. Conclusion: The Verdict on 2021+ Serviceability
The 2021+ Audi Q7 and Q8 represent a "hard border" in the automotive locksmith profession. They delineate the generalist from the specialist.
* For the Generalist: This vehicle is out of scope. The requirement for bench work, component removal (BCM2), and the potential need for third-party data calculation (Sync Data) makes it too risky for a standard "plug-and-play" mobile service. The risk of the 02811 error alone is a deterrent.
* For the Specialist: It is a lucrative but high-stakes job. Success requires significant investment in:
   1. Hardware: Owning the specific BCM2 solder-free adapters (Xhorse/Autel/ACDP) is mandatory to reduce the risk of board damage.
   2. Knowledge: Understanding the "Triangle of Trust" (BCM2-ECU-TCU) allows the technician to bid accurately on AKL jobs, knowing that they will need to bill for the extra labor of removing the engine computer.
   3. Inventory: Stocking the correct 4M0...CM (US) keys prevents costly comebacks.
Final Recommendation: For "All Keys Lost" scenarios on a 2021+ Q7/Q8, unless the locksmith has a verified, tested workflow for extracting ECU/TCU sync data and a reliable calculation partner (like PolDiag), the most prudent professional decision is often to refer the customer to the dealer or to perform the service using ODIS if valid GeKo credentials are held. The margin for error is razor-thin, and the cost of failure is substantial.

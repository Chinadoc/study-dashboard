The Modern Viking’s Vault: A Definitive Technical & Operational Dossier on Volvo Security Architecture (2016–2026)
1. Introduction: The Paradigm Shift in Swedish Automotive Security
The landscape of automotive locksmithing has undergone a radical transformation over the last decade, with Volvo Cars standing at the forefront of this cryptographic and architectural evolution. The period from 2016 to 2026 represents a complete departure from the legacy systems of the past—specifically the "P3" platform era—into a new age of hyper-connected, software-defined vehicles. For the modern automotive security professional, Volvo is no longer merely a vehicle to be serviced; it is a sophisticated IT network on wheels, requiring a synthesis of traditional craftsmanship, electrical engineering, and advanced digital forensics.
The introduction of the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) with the 2016 XC90 marked the beginning of this new era. It was followed closely by the Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) underpinning the XC40 and the electric C40 Recharge. These platforms transitioned Volvo from basic transponder-based immobilizers to complex, Ethernet-reliant security ecosystems where the "key" is less a physical object and more a digital credential within a high-speed data network. This shift has profound implications for the locksmithing industry. The days of simple OBD programming using generic tools are fading, replaced by procedures that demand proprietary communication protocols (DoIP), secure gateway bypasses, and in some cases, direct physical intervention with vehicle control modules.
Furthermore, the integration of Android Automotive OS (AAOS) in models starting from late 2021 has introduced a new layer of digital fortification. The "Google Car" ecosystem fundamentally alters how diagnostic tools handshake with the vehicle's Central Electronic Module (CEM), often rendering older equipment obsolete and demanding constant software vigilance from aftermarket tool manufacturers like Lonsdor and Autel.
This report serves as an exhaustive technical manual and strategic guide for the professional locksmith. It dissects the complete lifecycle of Volvo key programming for model years 2016–2026, covering the XC40, XC60, XC90, S60, S90, V60, V90, and the C40 Recharge. We will analyze the CEM architecture down to the microcontroller level, evaluate the efficacy of aftermarket versus OEM tools, detail the high-voltage safety protocols necessary for Electric Vehicle (EV) servicing, and provide a rigorous analysis of the business economics involved in mastering this niche.
2. Chronological Evolution of Volvo Security Platforms
Understanding the temporal progression of Volvo’s platforms is critical for the locksmith, as the "model year" dictates the available programming methods more than the specific model name. The evolution from 2016 to 2026 is characterized by three distinct phases, each introducing new layers of security and complexity.
Phase 1: The SPA Revolution (2016–2020)
The launch of the second-generation XC90 in 2016 introduced the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA). This platform replaced the older Ford-derived P3 architecture. The primary shift here was the move to a fully "Keyless Drive" system where the physical key blade became strictly for emergency access, and the transponder logic moved to a fully integrated CEM-based solution. During this phase, the communication backbone shifted heavily toward FlexRay and Ethernet for module-to-module data transfer, though the diagnostic port (OBDII) maintained standard CAN bus access for most aftermarket tools. This era is characterized by the widespread use of the Renesas R5F64524/5 microcontrollers in the CEM, which required specific "unlocking" procedures to read the PIN code essential for key programming.1
Phase 2: The CMA and Electrification Expansion (2018–2021)
With the introduction of the XC40 in 2018, Volvo debuted the Compact Modular Architecture (CMA). While sharing the same fundamental security logic as SPA (same key types, same encryption standards), CMA introduced physical layout changes that are highly relevant to the locksmith. The CEM was moved from deep within the dashboard to more accessible locations, altering the labor economics of "All Keys Lost" (AKL) scenarios. Simultaneously, this phase saw the introduction of mild-hybrid powertrains and the first fully electric models (XC40 Recharge), necessitating new safety protocols for technicians interacting with the vehicle's electrical centers.3
Phase 3: The Android and Secure Gateway Era (2021–2026)
The most significant recent disruption occurred around late 2021 with the rollout of Android Automotive OS (AAOS). Vehicles equipped with this Google-based infotainment system (identifiable by the native Google Maps interface) introduced a strengthened Vehicle Gateway Module (VGM) and updated CEM firmware. This update effectively "closed the door" on many OBD-based PIN reading methods that had been standard for years. For a period, locksmiths were forced to revert to bench-programming for all keys lost on these models. However, the aftermarket has since responded with "Super Updates" and specialized adapters (like the Lonsdor ADP) to bridge this gap, although the arms race between Volvo's security patches and aftermarket capabilities remains active.4
3. Architectural Foundations: SPA and CMA Platforms
To successfully program keys, one must navigate the vehicle's nervous system. The platform determines not just the location of the hardware, but the language the vehicle speaks.
3.1 Scalable Product Architecture (SPA)
The SPA platform is the foundation for Volvo's "60" and "90" series (XC90, XC60, S90, S60, V90, V60). It prioritizes flexibility in wheelbase and overhangs but standardizes the electrical architecture. The security system in SPA vehicles is deeply integrated. The Central Electronic Module (CEM) acts as the master controller for access authorization. Unlike older systems where an immobilizer box might be swapped, the SPA CEM is the repository for the "Shared Secret"—the cryptographic key that validates the transponder.
One of the defining challenges of the SPA platform for locksmiths is the physical accessibility of the CEM. In models like the XC90 and S90, the CEM is often located deep behind the dashboard on the passenger side, or accessible only after removing the wiper cowl assembly from the engine bay. This makes the physical removal of the unit—often required for unlocking the processor in AKL situations—a labor-intensive task, typically billed at 2.0 to 3.0 hours of labor.2
3.2 Compact Modular Architecture (CMA)
Debuting with the XC40, the CMA platform was designed from the outset to accommodate internal combustion, hybrid, and fully electric powertrains. While it shares the software logic of the SPA platform (meaning the key programming software steps are virtually identical), the hardware layout is significantly more technician-friendly.
In CMA vehicles (XC40, C40), the CEM is generally located behind the glove compartment or the A-pillar kick panel. This accessibility drastically reduces the labor time for bench programming procedures to approximately 30–45 minutes. For a locksmith business, this distinction is vital for accurate quoting; an AKL job on an XC40 yields a higher profit per hour than the same job on an XC90 due to the reduced labor overhead.5
3.3 Protocol Shift: Diagnostics over Internet Protocol (DoIP)
Both SPA and CMA platforms rely heavily on Ethernet for vehicle diagnostics. Traditional CAN bus communication is too slow for the massive data transfer required by modern Volvo modules. This is why older J2534 pass-thru devices or basic OBD scanners fail to communicate with these vehicles. Programming a key or performing a software reload requires a "DoIP" capable interface.
Official Volvo tools use the VOE (Vehicle over Ethernet) adapter, a specialized OBD-to-Ethernet cable. Aftermarket tools like the Autel IM608 and Lonsdor K518 have integrated DoIP protocols or provide specific adapters to handle this high-speed communication. Attempting to program these vehicles without a DoIP-compliant interface will result in communication failures or "Module Not Responding" errors.6
4. The Heart of the Beast: Central Electronic Module (CEM)
The Central Electronic Module (CEM) is the gatekeeper of the Volvo security system. In the P3 era (2007–2016), security data was often more distributed or accessible via easier storage mediums. In the SPA/CMA era, Volvo moved to a highly centralized, encrypted model.
4.1 The Renesas Challenge: Microcontroller Encryption
The vast majority of SPA and CMA CEMs utilize secure microcontrollers from the Renesas RH850 or R5F family (specifically R5F64524 / R5F64525). These chips are sophisticated automotive-grade processors designed with active "Read Protection." This means the memory sectors containing the vehicle's unique PIN code and security keys are locked against external reading.
You cannot simply clip a standard EEPROM reader onto the chip and "dump" the data as was common with older vehicles. To extract the PIN code necessary for programming a new key, the chip must be temporarily "unlocked." This unlocking process involves sending a specific sequence of commands to the processor to exploit a vulnerability or backdoor, allowing the data to be read. This is the core function of tools like the Lonsdor K518 or Autel G-Box when operating in "Bench Mode".8
4.2 The PIN Code: The Golden Ticket
Every key programming event in a modern Volvo requires the vehicle to authorize the request. This authorization is granted only when the diagnostic tool presents the correct 10-to-12 digit PIN code.
* Derivation: This PIN is derived from the unique configuration data stored in the CEM.
* Persistence: The PIN is static. It does not change (roll) like a rolling code. Once a locksmith has successfully read and recorded the PIN for a specific VIN, that PIN remains valid for the life of the CEM. This allows for faster repeat service if the customer loses a key again in the future.10
4.3 Extraction Methods: OBD vs. Bench
The method for obtaining this PIN code is the single biggest variable in the locksmith's workflow. It dictates the time, risk, and cost of the job.
Method A: Bench Reading (The Sure Thing)
For All Keys Lost (AKL) situations, or for vehicles with updated firmware that patches OBD vulnerabilities, removing the CEM is mandatory.
* Process:
   1. Disconnect Battery: This is critical. On Mild Hybrid (B5/B6) and EV models, failure to follow disconnect procedures can log high-voltage faults or damage the 48V/400V system.
   2. Removal: The locksmith physically extracts the CEM module from the vehicle.
   3. Connection: Modern tools have moved away from soldering wires to the board. The standard now is "solder-free" adapters. The Lonsdor ADP or Autel G-Box connects via a specialized interface board that clips directly onto the CEM's pin headers, ensuring a secure connection without thermal stress to the PCB components.11
   4. Decryption: The tool reads the encrypted data dump, calculates the PIN code, and saves it. The CEM is then reinstalled in the vehicle.


  



Method B: OBD Calculation (The Time Saver)
Tools like Lonsdor K518 Pro and Volvo VIDA (official) can often extract the PIN via the OBDII port without removing the module.
* Mechanism: The tool sends a cryptographic challenge to the CEM. The tool's software (or a connected server) analyzes the CEM's response to calculate the PIN.
* Limitations:
   * Time: This process can be fast (15 minutes) or painfully slow (up to several hours with methods like VDASH).
   * Firmware Blocks: Volvo frequently updates CEM software during dealer service visits. A 2018 XC90 that visited a dealer in 2024 for a software update may have a "patched" CEM that refuses OBD extraction, forcing the locksmith to revert to the Bench method. This unpredictability means a professional must always be prepared for a bench job.10
5. The Key Ecosystem: Fobs, Tags, and Blades
Volvo's approach to key hardware in the SPA/CMA era is distinct, utilizing a modular system that separates user interfaces (buttons) from the passive security tag. All modern Volvo keys for this era operate on 434 MHz (or 433.92 MHz) in the US and European markets, utilizing Hitag 3 / AES 128-bit encryption. While 315 MHz systems exist, they are extremely rare and typically limited to specific Asian market imports or very early US models.13
5.1 The Three Pillars of Volvo Access


  



The ecosystem consists of three distinct physical key form factors:
1. Primary Fob (Standard Remote): This is the main key, usually wrapped in leather matching the vehicle's interior or in black plastic. It features buttons on the side (Lock, Unlock, Trunk, Panic). It uses a standard, user-replaceable CR2032 battery.
2. Care Key (Orange Key): Introduced widely around 2021, this key features a bright orange housing. Electrically, it is identical to the standard MS (Motion Sensing) key. However, it allows the owner to set a restricted top speed for the vehicle (e.g., for teen drivers). Locksmiths should note that these keys can be reprogrammed to function as standard keys if the restriction is lifted via software, or they can simply be used as a standard key body with the restriction disabled.15
3. Sport Key (Key Tag / Surf Key): This is a small, black, button-less waterproof tag (IP67 rated). It is designed for active use where a bulky fob is inconvenient. It contains the same transponder and passive entry technology as the main fob.
5.2 The "Sport Key" Epidemic: Failure and Opportunity
The Sport Key represents the single most common failure point in the modern Volvo key ecosystem, and consequently, the largest revenue opportunity for locksmiths.
* The Design Flaw: To achieve waterproofing, the unit is ultrasonically welded shut. It contains a non-rechargeable battery. When this battery dies—typically within 2 to 4 years—the key becomes useless. The vehicle will display "Key Tag Battery Low" and eventually stop recognizing it.
* The Dealer Solution: Volvo dealers do not repair these. They sell a replacement unit (Part Number 32398432) for approximately $200–$300, plus programming labor, often totaling over $500.17
* The Locksmith Solution:
   * Replacement: Locksmiths can supply high-quality aftermarket tags (often with a modifiable case that allows future battery changes) for a fraction of the cost.
   * Conversion: Many customers, frustrated by the tag's limitations, opt to have a standard 4-button fob programmed instead. The car does not distinguish between the types; it treats them all as valid authorization tokens.
5.3 Motion Sensing (MS) Keys: The 2021+ Standard
Starting in 2021, Volvo introduced "Motion Sensing" fobs to combat relay attacks (where thieves amplify the signal of a key sitting inside a house to open a car in the driveway).
* Functionality: These keys contain an accelerometer. If the key remains stationary for a set period (minutes), it stops transmitting its signal.
* Identification: These keys are identified by the suffix MS in the FCC ID (e.g., YG0HUF8423MS).
* Operational Nuance: When programming an MS key, or checking it with a frequency tester, the locksmith must shake or move the key to wake it up. A perfectly functional key may appear "dead" on a tester simply because it is in sleep mode.
* Compatibility: MS keys are generally backward compatible with older SPA vehicles. However, non-MS keys (older stock) may not be accepted by 2022+ vehicles that expect the MS protocol. It is strategically sound for locksmiths to stock primarily MS-version keys to ensure universal coverage.13
5.4 Key Blades and Mechanical Access
While the system is "Keyless," mechanical access remains vital for dead battery situations.
* Blade Type: All SPA/CMA fobs use the HU101 keyway. This is a 2-track, high-security laser cut key.
* Emergency Access: The blade is hidden inside the body of the standard fob (slide the catch to release). In the C40/XC40 Recharge, the physical lock cylinder is hidden behind a trim piece on the driver's door handle, which must be carefully popped off to access the cylinder.20
6. Tooling Ecosystem: The Big Three
A locksmith's capability is defined by their choice of tools. For Volvo 2016–2026, the hierarchy is distinct, with three primary players dominating the market.


  



6.1 Lonsdor (The Specialist)
The Lonsdor K518ISE / K518 Pro is widely regarded as the specialist leader for Volvo aftermarket programming.
* Strengths: Lonsdor was the first to market with semi-smart key programming via OBD. Their Super Update (rolled out in phases through 2024 and 2025) enabled OBD PIN reading for many 2022+ models that previously required bench work.
* The ADP Adapter: Lonsdor's specific adapter for bench reading (the ADP) is a standout feature. It allows for a solder-free connection to the CEM, bypassing the need to modify the circuit board. This drastically reduces the risk of damaging the expensive CEM unit.4
* Updates: Lonsdor is notably aggressive with Volvo updates, often releasing solutions for new firmware versions months ahead of competitors.
6.2 Autel (The All-Rounder)
The Autel MaxiIM IM608 Pro II / IM508S is the standard workhorse for most locksmith shops.
* Strengths: Its "Smart Mode" offers guided functions with photos of CEM locations and test point diagrams, making it excellent for technicians less familiar with Volvo architecture. The G-Box3 accessory is essential for faster password calculation during bench procedures.
* Weaknesses: Autel can be slower to crack PINs via OBD compared to Lonsdor. It also faces intermittent gaps in coverage for the very latest AAOS (2023+) models, sometimes forcing a bench read where Lonsdor might succeed via OBD.2
6.3 Volvo VIDA (The Official Route)
For 2023+ models or "bricked" situations where aftermarket tools fail, the OEM tool is the ultimate fallback.
* Hardware Requirement: You must have a VOE (Vehicle over Ethernet) adapter. The older DiCE (J2534) units are too slow for the massive data transfer required by the SPA/CMA architecture and will often time out or fail.
* The VIDA Process:
   1. Subscription: Purchase a 3-day subscription from the official Volvo technical information site (approx. $73–$85).
   2. Software: Download the VIDA application to a Windows 10/11 Professional laptop.
   3. Purchase: Within VIDA, buy the "Add Key" software packet specific to the VIN (approx. $70–$80).
   4. Programming: Connect via the VOE adapter. The system downloads the software directly to the car, authorizing the key.
* The "Virgin Key" Rule: VIDA checks the key's unique ID against a central database. It will only accept a brand new, virgin OEM key. It will reject refurbished or used keys unless they have been professionally "unlocked" and reset to a truly virgin state, which is difficult for newer encryption types.23
6.4 OBDSTAR
OBDSTAR (specifically the X300 DP Plus or G3) is a viable budget alternative. It has made strides in reading PIN codes via OBD for SPA models but generally lags behind Lonsdor in coverage for the newest CMA and AAOS vehicles. It is a solid backup tool but perhaps not a primary choice for a high-volume Volvo specialist.26
7. Operational Procedures: Programming Workflows
The operational success of a Volvo locksmith job depends on choosing the right workflow: Add Key versus All Keys Lost (AKL).
7.1 "Add Key" (Spare Key) Workflow
This is the lowest risk procedure. In many cases, the presence of a working valid key allows the tool to bypass the complex PIN extraction process entirely.
1. Verification: Confirm the frequency and type of the new key.
2. Placement: Place the working key in the designated "backup reader" spot. In SPA vehicles (XC90/XC60), this is usually in the center console cupholder (marked with a key symbol). In the XC40/C40, it is also in the cupholder or a specific storage bin.
3. Bypass: Select "Add Key" on the tool (Autel/Lonsdor). The tool reads the authorization data from the working key.
4. Learning: The tool will prompt to remove the working key and place the new key in the reader. The CEM writes the new Key ID into its "White List."
5. Synchronization: Test the lock/unlock buttons immediately. If they do not work, run the "Key Synchronization" function.
7.2 "All Keys Lost" (AKL) Workflow
This is the high-stakes service. Without a working key, the CEM is locked down.
1. Phase 1: Unlock CEM:
   * OBD Attempt: Always attempt an OBD PIN read first. Connect a battery maintainer (13.5V). Launch the "Read CEM Security Data" function. If successful (usually 15–30 mins), proceed to Phase 2.
   * Bench Mode: If OBD fails (Security Access Denied), proceed to remove the CEM (as detailed in Section 4). Connect via the adapter (G-Box/ADP) on the bench. Read the data, calculate the PIN, and reinstall the CEM.
2. Phase 2: Programming:
   * With the PIN code saved in the tool, reconnect via OBD.
   * Initiate "All Keys Lost" or "Learn Key" function.
   * The tool will ask for the PIN (it usually auto-fills this from the previous step).
   * Place the new key in the cupholder coil.
   * Closing the Session: A crucial nuance in Volvo programming is that the session must be "closed" or "verified" to finalize the key. Some software versions require you to explicitly select "Finish" or "No More Keys" to write the final configuration.
7.3 The "Keys Count" Nuance
Unlike some manufacturers where deleting keys requires all keys to be present (e.g., Ford), Volvo systems allow you to add a key without deleting the others. However, in an AKL scenario, it is best practice to delete all missing keys from the CEM memory. This ensures that if the lost keys were stolen, they can no longer start the vehicle.
8. Electric Vehicle Specifics: C40 & XC40 Recharge
The introduction of the Recharge line (EVs) brings high-voltage safety into the locksmith's domain. While the key programming logic remains largely the same (CMA platform), the physical environment has drastically changed.
8.1 High Voltage Safety Protocol
WARNING: The CEM in the C40 and XC40 Recharge is located in the passenger compartment, often near high-voltage orange cabling routing to the heater or charging modules. While the CEM itself is a 12V component, accidental contact with compromised high-voltage insulation can be fatal.
* The Mandate: Before performing any bench work that involves removing dashboard panels on a Recharge model, the locksmith must locate and pull the Manual Service Disconnect (MSD).
* Locations:
   * XC40 Recharge (Early Models): Often located under the hood (frunk) near the washer fluid filler, under a plastic trim panel.
   * C40 / Later XC40s: May be located under the rear passenger seat or in the center tunnel console area. Consult the specific owner's manual or rescue guide for the VIN.
* Procedure:
   1. Turn the vehicle off.
   2. Open the hood/frunk and keep the key fob at least 5 meters away to ensure the car sleeps.
   3. Locate the green/orange MSD loop.
   4. Pull the lever/plug to open the HV circuit.
   5. Wait 5 minutes for the capacitors to discharge before touching any connectors.3
8.2 The "Ignition On" Simulation
Recharge models do not have a Start/Stop button. They use a seat sensor combined with key presence to determine "Ready" state. This confuses standard key programming procedures that ask the technician to "Turn Ignition On."
* The Workaround: To simulate "Ignition On" (Key Position II) for programming:
   1. Sit in the driver's seat (engaging the weight sensor).
   2. Close all doors.
   3. Tap the brake pedal (do not hold). The dashboard screens should light up.
   4. Alternatively, locate the media/volume knob in the center console and press/hold the "Play/Pause" button for roughly 5 seconds. This forces the infotainment and gateway modules into an active state suitable for diagnostic communication.
9. Profitability & Business Strategy
The Volvo market represents a "high barrier, high reward" segment. The complexity of the system scares away generalist locksmiths, leaving the market open for specialists who can charge a premium.


  



9.1 Cost Analysis
* Hardware: An OEM quality aftermarket Volvo fob costs approximately $40 – $70 from suppliers like UHS Hardware or Key4. An official OEM key from a dealer parts counter costs $150 – $220.
* Software: If using an aftermarket tool with a valid subscription, the "per key" cost is essentially zero. If using VIDA, the cost is approximately $150 per session (Subscription + Software Download).
9.2 Pricing Strategy
* Spare Key: The going rate for a mobile locksmith to provide and program a spare Volvo smart key is $350 – $450.
   * Margin: With a $50 fob and 30 minutes of labor, the net profit is ~$300+.
* All Keys Lost: The market rate is $650 – $900.
   * Comparison: Dealers often charge $1,200+ for AKL (including towing and labor).
   * Margin: Even with 2 hours of labor for a bench job, the profit exceeds $600 per job.
* Sport Key Replacement: Pricing a Sport Key replacement at $250 creates a "no-brainer" decision for customers facing a $500 dealer quote, while still yielding a massive margin on a $40 part.
9.3 Inventory Strategy
To maximize efficiency, a locksmith should stock:
1. Universal "Smart" Keys: Tools like Lonsdor LT20 or Autel IKEY universal remotes can be generated to emulate the Volvo protocol. This allows you to carry one SKU that covers XC40, XC60, and XC90.
2. Emergency Blades: Stock HU101 blades in bulk.
3. OEM "Sport Keys": Carry 2–3 units. While aftermarket options exist, some customers insist on the OEM look for the waterproof tag.
10. Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls
Even with the best tools, the Volvo architecture can be unforgiving.
10.1 "Security Access Denied" on OBD
* Symptom: The tool attempts to read the PIN but fails after 10–15 minutes.
* Cause: The CEM firmware is too new (patched) or battery voltage is unstable.
* Solution:
   1. Ensure a robust battery maintainer is supplying 13.5V.
   2. If it fails twice, do not persist. Repeated failures can trigger a temporary "Anti-Scan" lockout in the CEM. Move immediately to the Bench method (ADP/G-Box).
10.2 "Key Not Detected" After Programming
* Symptom: The programming says "Success," but the car says "Key Not Found."
* Cause:
   * The key is a "Motion Sensing" key and has fallen asleep.
   * The cupholder coil is obstructed by rubber mats, coins, or metal cups.
   * The key frequency is incorrect (e.g., trying to program a 315MHz key to a 434MHz car).
* Solution:
   * Shake the key vigorously to wake the accelerometer.
   * Remove the rubber cupholder insert to place the key directly on the plastic sensor area.
   * Verify the key frequency with a tester.
10.3 Remote Works, Car Won't Start
* Symptom: Buttons lock/unlock the doors, but the start knob/button does nothing.
* Cause: Desynchronization between the Remote Control (RKE) ID and the Immobilizer (IMMO) ID. This can happen if the key was "cloned" rather than properly "added," or if the battery was dead for an extended period.
* Solution: Perform a "Key Synchronization" function in the diagnostic tool. This forces the CEM to re-align the rolling codes for both functions.
11. Conclusion: The Future is Connected
As we look toward 2026, the trajectory for Volvo security is clear. The integration of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology in the upcoming EX90 and updated models will make relay attacks nearly impossible, but will also make aftermarket key emulation significantly harder. Furthermore, the push toward Phone-as-a-Key (PaaK) suggests a future where the "key" is a digital credential provisioning process managed via an OEM portal rather than a physical object programming task.
However, for the millions of SPA and CMA vehicles on the road today—and for the next decade—the need for physical key services remains acute. The locksmith who invests in the right training (bench work, EV safety) and the right tools (Lonsdor/Autel/DoIP) positions themselves in a lucrative, low-competition niche. The "Viking’s Vault" is secure, but for the skilled professional equipped with this knowledge, it is open for business.

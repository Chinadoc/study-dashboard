3. Summary of Visual Identification
If you cannot verify the production date, check the dashboard and head unit:
1. Instrument Cluster:
   * Analog dials with plastic rings: Almost always FEM or BDC1.
   * Hybrid dials (Digital screen but physical chrome rings glued to glass): This is "Live Cockpit Plus" (ID6). It is BDC2.
   * Fully Digital (Angular bracket shape, no physical rings): This is "Live Cockpit Professional" (ID7). It is BDC3.
   * One giant curved glass panel (Cluster + Radio merged): This is "Curved Display" (ID8/8.5). It is BCP.
2. Immobilizer Box Location:
   * FEM: Passenger footwell (side wall), usually white or black plastic.
   * BDC (all versions): Passenger footwell (side wall), black plastic.
   * Distinction: BDC2 has a specific connector layout for LIN bus lighting. BDC3 introduces Gigabit Ethernet (OABR) ports directly on the module for the "Ethernet Ring."

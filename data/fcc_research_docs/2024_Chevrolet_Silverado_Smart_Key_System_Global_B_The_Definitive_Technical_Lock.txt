2024 Chevrolet Silverado Smart Key System (Global B): The Definitive Technical Locksmith Guide
1. Introduction: The Paradigm Shift to Global B
The automotive security landscape has undergone a seismic shift with the introduction and proliferation of General Motors' Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP), colloquially and technically known within the aftermarket as the Global B architecture. For the professional locksmith, the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado is not merely a continuation of the legacy "C/K" truck platform; it represents a fortress of digital encryption, centralized gateways, and high-speed data protocols that render traditional key programming methods obsolete.
The transition from the previous Global A architecture—which served as the industry standard for GM vehicles from approximately 2010 to 2019—to Global B marks a fundamental change in how vehicle control modules communicate and authenticate external devices. Where Global A allowed for relatively open communication between diagnostic tools and the Body Control Module (BCM) via standard Controller Area Network (CAN) bus lines, Global B introduces a Serial Data Gateway Module (SDGM) that acts as a rigorous cybersecurity firewall. This gateway creates a "kill chain" for unauthorized access, filtering all requests entering through the OBDII port and blocking any that do not possess the correct, encrypted digital certificates.
For the locksmith attempting to service a 2024 Silverado, this means that the trusty programming tools of the past decade—unless updated with specific hardware adapters and server-side authentication capabilities—will fail to even detect the vehicle's immobilizer system. The architecture relies heavily on CAN-FD (Controller Area Network with Flexible Data-Rate), a protocol that enables data transmission speeds significantly higher than the standard High-Speed CAN used in previous generations. This increase in bandwidth is necessary not only for the vehicle's advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and Super Cruise capabilities but also for carrying the complex, rolling-code encryption keys required to authorize a new key fob.
This report serves as a comprehensive technical dossier for the automotive security professional. It dissects the Global B architecture as it applies specifically to the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado, detailing the necessary tooling, the nuances of the HU100 V-Series mechanical lock system, the specific frequency and modulation of the Hitag Pro ID49 transponders, and the precise, step-by-step programming protocols required to navigate this digital fortress.


 Image 2. Electronic Architecture and Communication Protocols
To successfully program a key to a 2024 Silverado, one must first understand the environment in which the programming tool operates. The Global B architecture is defined by its refusal to trust external inputs.
2.1 The Serial Data Gateway Module (SDGM)
The heart of the security challenge in the 2024 Silverado is the SDGM. In previous generations, the Data Link Connector (DLC/OBDII port) wires ran directly to the BCM and other high-speed modules. A locksmith's tool could physically tap into the communication lines and broadcast "wake-up" commands or "key learn" requests directly to the target module.
In the Global B topology, the OBDII port connects only to the SDGM. This module functions similarly to a high-end network router with deep packet inspection capabilities. When a tool is connected, the SDGM analyzes the data packets. If the tool attempts to send a command to the BCM (such as "Add Key") without first performing a proprietary, encrypted handshake with the SDGM, the gateway drops the packets immediately. The tool will report "Communication Error" or "No Response" because, effectively, the BCM never received the request. This firewall mechanism was implemented to prevent unauthorized access and potential hacking of safety-critical systems, but it presents a significant hurdle for legitimate aftermarket service.
2.2 CAN-FD: The Language of Global B
The physical layer of communication in the 2024 Silverado is CAN-FD. While standard CAN bus networks operate at speeds up to 1 Megabit per second (Mbps) with a data payload of 8 bytes per frame, CAN-FD allows for data rates up to 5-8 Mbps with a payload of up to 64 bytes per frame.
This expanded payload is crucial for security. In a standard 8-byte CAN frame, there is very little room for complex cryptographic keys. A potential attacker could theoretically brute-force the short key. With the 64-byte payload of CAN-FD, GM engineers can embed significantly longer, military-grade encryption keys (128-bit AES) into the communication frames.
Implications for Locksmith Tools: Most legacy key programmers (e.g., Autel IM608 Gen 1 without adapter, OBDSTAR DP Plus legacy hardware) utilize standard CAN transceivers. When these tools attempt to read the high-speed data stream from a 2024 Silverado, they cannot interpret the flexible data rate switching. They perceive the high-speed portion of the message as signal noise or error frames. Consequently, the tool cannot read the VIN, communicating with the vehicle is impossible, and the programming session fails before it begins. Success on this platform requires hardware that natively supports the CAN-FD ISO 11898-2:2016 standard.
2.3 The Immobilization Hierarchy
The authorization to start the engine involves a synchronized "handshake" across multiple control units, all of which must agree that the key is valid.
1. Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS) System: Typically integrated into the BCM in modern GM trucks, this system uses Low-Frequency (LF) antennas to wake up the key fob and Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) receivers to listen for the fob's encrypted response.
2. Body Control Module (BCM): The primary storehouse for key identifiers. It validates the cryptographic response from the key against its stored "Allow List."
3. Engine Control Module (ECM): Even if the BCM validates the key, the engine will not start unless the BCM sends a secure, encrypted "Go" message to the ECM. In Global B vehicles, this BCM-ECM link is also highly encrypted to prevent "module swapping" attacks (e.g., swapping in a hacked BCM to steal the truck).
4. Telematics / OnStar: In Global B, the vehicle's connectivity module plays a role in server-side authentication for dealer programming events, verifying the tool's legitimacy in real-time.
3. Transponder Hardware: Part Numbers and Specifications
The 2024 Silverado utilizes a specific generation of smart keys that differ internally from previous "look-alike" remotes. While a 2019 Silverado fob might physically look identical to a 2024 fob, the internal transponder logic is incompatible due to the shift in encryption standards.
3.1 Frequency and Modulation
The Smart Key system operates on a dual-frequency basis. The vehicle pings the key on a 125 kHz (Low Frequency) channel to determine its location (inside vs. outside the cabin). The key responds on a 433.92 MHz (Ultra High Frequency) channel. It is critical to note that while many older GM products operated on 315 MHz, the Global B platform has largely standardized on 433 MHz for the North American market to support higher bandwidth data transmission between the fob and the vehicle.
3.2 Transponder Technology: NXP Hitag Pro ID49
The core security chip within the 2024 Silverado key is the NXP Hitag Pro, often classified by locksmith tools as ID49. This chip supports 128-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) mutual authentication.
* Contrast with Legacy: Older GM smart keys (Global A) typically used the NXP Hitag 2 (ID46) or Hitag 3 (ID47) protocols.
* Interchangeability: An ID46 or ID47 key from a 2018 Silverado or Equinox cannot be programmed to a 2024 Silverado. The BCM expects an ID49 AES response. If the incorrect chip type is presented during the programming sequence, the vehicle will simply ignore it, leading to the frustrating "No Remote Detected" error on the dashboard.
3.3 OEM Part Numbers and FCC IDs
Locksmiths must verify the FCC ID before attempting programming. The definitive FCC ID for the 2024 Silverado Smart Key is YG0G21TB2.

Important Note on Aftermarket Keys: While aftermarket "universal" keys (like the Xhorse XM38 series) are becoming more capable, Global B vehicles are notoriously sensitive to signal timing. For the highest success rate and to avoid "Remote Learn Pending" errors, OEM keys or high-quality refurbished OEM keys are strongly recommended for the 2024 model year. The "Universal" smart keys often lack the specific proximity range calibration required by the Silverado's large cabin antennas.
3.4 Battery Requirements
The fob utilizes a CR2450 lithium coin cell battery. This larger battery (compared to the pervasive CR2032) provides the necessary current for the higher-power encrypted transmissions and ensures a longer lifespan despite the frequent "handshakes" performed by the Passive Entry system. A weak battery in a new unprogrammed fob can cause programming failures; always check voltage (aim for >3.1V) before starting.
4. Mechanical Security: The HU100 V-Series System
While the electronic side of the 2024 Silverado is cutting-edge, the mechanical interface remains grounded in the HU100 high-security "laser cut" system. However, a critical distinction exists between the HU100 system used on passenger cars (Cruze, Malibu) and the version used on full-size trucks.
4.1 V-Series (10-Cut) vs. Z-Series (8-Cut)
The GM HU100 keyway comes in two primary depth/spacing configurations:
* 8-Cut (Z-Series): Common on 2010-2016 sedans and compact SUVs.
* 10-Cut (V-Series): The standard for the Silverado/Sierra platform since 2014.
The 2024 Silverado utilizes the 10-Cut V-Series system. This system places 10 wafer positions along the key blade. The key code series ranges from V0001 to V5573. Using an 8-cut decoding tool or attempting to cut an 8-cut profile onto the key will result in a mechanical key that inserts but does not turn, or worse, becomes jammed in the lock cylinder.


 Image 4.2 Decoding the Door Lock
Although the 2024 Silverado features Push-to-Start ignition, a mechanical lock cylinder is present on the driver's door handle for emergency access.
* Tool: Lishi HU100 (10-Cut) 2-in-1 Pick & Decoder.
* Wafer Configuration: The door lock typically contains wafers in positions 4 through 10 or 3 through 10. It rarely contains cuts 1 and 2.
* Decoding Strategy:
   1. Insert the Lishi tool fully.
   2. Apply tension.
   3. Pick the lock to the open position.
   4. Decode the wafer depths (1-4) for positions 3-10.
   5. For key origination, the missing cuts (1 and 2) can usually be inferred or progressed by the cutting machine software (e.g., "Find Bitting" on Dolphin/Condor), as the ignition cylinder (which would contain cuts 1 and 2) is absent. The mechanical key's primary function is solely to open the door, so cuts 3-10 are sufficient for emergency access.
4.3 Ignition Cylinder Considerations
In the rare event of a fleet model or chassis-cab variant equipped with a keyed ignition (extremely uncommon for 2024 but possible in heavy-duty commercial trims), or if servicing related older chassis, the ignition cylinder would contain wafers 1-7 or 1-8. If an ignition cylinder must be removed without a working key, the AccuReader HU100 Ignition Removal Tool (specifically V3 or V4 for the 10-cut system) is required. This tool interacts with the active retainer pin to allow removal in the "OFF" position, a feature unique to the GM HU100 design.
5. Programming Methodologies: OEM vs. Aftermarket
The programming of the 2024 Silverado is the most technically demanding aspect of the job. Two distinct pathways exist: the official OEM method using Techline Connect, and the evolving aftermarket method using specialized CAN-FD programmers.
5.1 Method A: OEM Programming (Techline Connect / SPS2)
This is the "Gold Standard" for reliability. It uses GM's own servers to authenticate the session and bypass the SDGM firewall securely. It is the only method guaranteed to work if the BCM has been replaced or if the vehicle has the latest, un-cracked firmware.
Requirements:
* Hardware: A J2534 Passthrough device that is fully CAN-FD compliant. The GM MDI2 (EL-52100) is the official tool. High-quality aftermarket interfaces like the Autel MaxiFlash VCMI or DrewTech Cardaq Plus 3 are also compatible. Warning: Older MDI1 units or standard J2534 cables will fail because they cannot handle the CAN-FD protocol.
* Software: A laptop running Windows 10/11 Professional with the ACDelco Techline Connect (TLC) suite installed.
* Subscription: A "Vehicle Programming" subscription (SPS2) purchased from ACDelco TDS (approx. $45 per VIN).
* Credentials: A NASTF VSP (Vehicle Security Professional) ID is strictly required to access key codes and immobilizer functions within SPS2. Without a VSP ID, the "Immobilizer Learn" menu may be grayed out or inaccessible.
Procedure:
1. Connect the CAN-FD compliant VCI to the vehicle and laptop.
2. Launch Techline Connect and log in.
3. Connect to the vehicle. The system will auto-detect the VIN.
4. Navigate to SPS2 (Service Programming System).
5. Select "Immobilizer Learn" -> "Body Control Module".
6. Choose the appropriate function: "Program Transponder or Remote Key (Add)" or "Body Control Module IMMO Setup" (for All Keys Lost).
7. Follow the on-screen prompts precisely. The server will decrypt the BCM security, placing the vehicle into learn mode. This process usually involves a 10-12 minute security wait time.
5.2 Method B: Aftermarket Programming (Autel, Lonsdor, OBDSTAR)
For locksmiths without NASTF credentials or those seeking a mobile, laptop-free solution, the aftermarket has developed powerful tools that can interface with the Global B architecture. These tools often use "server calculation" methods where the tool reads encrypted data from the car, sends it to the manufacturer's (e.g., Autel's) cloud server to calculate the PIN/Seed, and sends the result back to the car.
Tool Capability Matrix: 2024 Silverado (Global B)


 Image 1. Lonsdor K518 Pro (Gen 2)
The Lonsdor K518 Pro has emerged as a leader for GM Global B programming due to its integrated CAN-FD hardware and aggressive software updates.
* Key Feature: It can read the PIN code directly via OBD for many Global B models without needing to disassemble the dashboard or solder wires.
* Procedure:
   1. Connect K518 Pro to OBD. Ensure Wi-Fi is connected.
   2. Menu: Immo & Remote -> Chevrolet -> Silverado -> 2021-2024 -> Smart Key.
   3. Select "Read PIN Code". The tool will communicate with the BCM via CAN-FD. This may take several minutes.
   4. Once the PIN is retrieved, select "Add Smart Key" or "All Smart Keys Lost".
   5. Input the PIN when prompted to unlock the BCM.
   6. Follow the sequence to place the key in the programming pocket (see Section 6).
2. Autel IM508S / IM608 Pro II
Autel remains the industry standard but requires specific hardware.
* Hardware Requirement: You MUST use the V200 VCI (included with KM100/IM508S) or the MaxiFlash VCMI (included with IM608 Pro II). The older J2534 box from the original IM608 will not work without a separate CAN-FD adapter plugged into the OBD port.
* Procedure:
   1. Connect VCI. Ensure tablet has strong Wi-Fi.
   2. Menu: GM -> Manual Selection -> Chevrolet -> Silverado -> 2024.
   3. Select "Control Unit" -> "Keyless System (CAN-FD)".
   4. Select "Immo Status Scan" to verify communication.
   5. Select "Add Key" (if a working key exists) or "All Keys Lost".
   6. The tool will attempt to calculate the PIN via the Autel server. Note: Coverage for 2024 models is rolling out progressively. If the tool cannot calculate the PIN (indicated by a "Calculation Failed" message), the locksmith may need to purchase the PIN code from a third-party service or NASTF and enter it manually.
6. Critical Diagnostics: Voltage and Slot Location
Two physical factors cause nearly 80% of programming failures on the 2024 Silverado: voltage instability and incorrect key placement.
6.1 Voltage Stabilization: The 13.5V Mandate
Global B modules are exceedingly sensitive to voltage fluctuations. During the programming process, the BCM enters a "bootloader" state where it writes data to its flash memory. This process is power-intensive.
* The Risk: If the vehicle voltage drops below 12.5V during the writing phase, the write process may abort, potentially corrupting the BCM's firmware ("bricking" the module). Conversely, voltage spikes from low-quality chargers can trigger the SDGM's protection mode, shutting down communication.
* The Solution: A standard "battery charger" is insufficient due to AC ripple "noise." Locksmiths must use a Power Supply Unit (PSU) or a high-quality battery maintainer (like the Clore PL2320 or similar) set to "Supply Mode" or "Flash Mode" to maintain a steady 13.4V - 13.5V throughout the entire session.
6.2 The Programming Pocket: Bench vs. Bucket Seats
The 2024 Silverado has two distinct interior configurations, and the location of the immobilizer backup coil (the "programming pocket") is different for each. Placing the key in the wrong spot will result in the vehicle failing to detect the fob during the learning phase.
Scenario A: Bucket Seats (LTZ, High Country, RST, ZR2)
* Configuration: Full center console that flows into the dashboard.
* Pocket Location: The pocket is located inside the center console storage bin or, more commonly on the 2024 refresh, in a designated vertical slot immediately adjacent to or inside the cup holders nearest the dashboard.
* Action: Look for a small slot specifically sized for the fob. Insert the fob buttons facing rearward (or up, depending on the specific mold).
Scenario B: Bench Seat (WT, Custom, Custom Trail Boss)
* Configuration: A folding center armrest that doubles as a third front seat.
* Pocket Location: Fold down the center armrest. Open the storage compartment lid. The pocket is a molded depression at the very bottom front of this storage bin.
* Action: Place the fob flat in this depression, buttons facing UP.


 Image 7. Step-by-Step Programming Procedures
7.1 "Add Key" Procedure (Onboard / No Tools Required)
Prerequisite: You must have two already programmed, working keys. This method is often disabled on fleet vehicles.
1. Place the two working keys in the vehicle's cupholder.
2. Insert the mechanical key blade of the new (unprogrammed) key into the driver's door lock cylinder.
3. Turn the key to the Unlock position 5 times within 10 seconds.
4. The Driver Information Center (DIC) will display "Ready for Remote #3".
5. Place the new key into the programming pocket (see Section 6.2).
6. Press the Engine Start/Stop button.
7. Verify the DIC displays "Remote Learned".
8. Press and hold the Start/Stop button for 12 seconds to exit.
7.2 "All Keys Lost" Procedure (Diagnostic Tool Required)
Prerequisite: No working keys available. Requires Autel IM608/Lonsdor K518 Pro/SPS2.
1. Prep: Connect PSU (13.5V). Connect Tool. Ensure Internet is active.
2. Access: Enter the vehicle menu (Chevrolet -> Silverado -> 2024 -> Smart Key).
3. Execute: Select "All Smart Keys Lost".
4. Calculation: The tool will read vehicle data and contact the server to calculate the 4-digit PIN. (Duration: 5-15 mins). If calculation fails, manually enter the PIN purchased from NASTF.
5. Erase: The tool will command the BCM to wipe existing keys. Warning: The vehicle is now immobilized. Do not disconnect power.
6. Learn Key 1:
   * The DIC will prompt "Place Remote 1 in Pocket".
   * Place the new key in the correct slot.
   * Press the Start/Stop button.
   * Wait for "Remote Learned" on the DIC.
7. Learn Key 2 (Optional): Remove Key 1, insert Key 2, press Start/Stop.
8. Exit: Follow tool prompts to exit learning mode. Test all functions (Proximity Start, Remote Start, Lock/Unlock).
8. Troubleshooting Decision Tree
When things go wrong, systematic diagnosis is key.
Symptom: "No Remote Detected" during programming.
* Cause 1: Incorrect Pocket Location. Fix: Re-verify trim level (Bench vs. Bucket) and ensure key is sitting flat/secure.
* Cause 2: Wrong Frequency/Chip. Fix: Verify FCC ID is YG0G21TB2. An older 315MHz or Global A (HYQ1AA) key will NOT work.
* Cause 3: Dead Battery in New Fob. Fix: Replace with fresh CR2450.
Symptom: Tool Fails to Connect / "Communication Error"
* Cause 1: Missing CAN-FD Adapter. Fix: If using older hardware (IM608 Gen 1), you must attach the CAN-FD adapter to the OBD port.
* Cause 2: Vehicle Asleep. Fix: Tap the brake pedal or turn on hazard lights to wake the CAN bus.
* Cause 3: SDGM Lockout. Fix: Perform a "Hard Reset" (disconnect vehicle battery negative terminal for 10 minutes) to reset the gateway.


 Image 9. Conclusion
The 2024 Chevrolet Silverado represents the new baseline for automotive locksmithing. Success is no longer determined solely by mechanical aptitude but by the ability to navigate a complex IT infrastructure comprising encrypted CAN-FD networks, cloud-based authentication servers, and rigorous voltage requirements. By adhering to the protocols outlined in this guide—specifically the use of CAN-FD capable tooling, the strict maintenance of system voltage, and the precise identification of hardware variants—the automotive security professional can confidently service these vehicles, turning a technological barrier into a profitable service opportunity.

2. Technical Deep Dive: CAS3 vs. CAS3+
While they look identical externally (black or white rectangular box), the internal security logic is different.
Feature
	CAS 3 (Base)
	CAS 3+ (Secure/ISTAP)
	Approx. Year
	2004 – 2007 (Early)
	2007 – 2013 (Late)
	ISN Length
	4 Bytes (Short ISN)
	16 Bytes (Long ISN)
	Security
	Low. OBD Key learning is fast.
	High. Requires "Downgrade" or Flash to read OBD.
	Encryption
	Static Rolling Code.
	Cryptographic challenge-response (OM23S mask).
	Key Function
	Starts car.
	Starts car + Enhanced Anti-Theft handshake.
	DME Pairing
	DME ISN is 4 bytes.
	DME ISN is 16 bytes (128-bit).
	Update
	Can be flashed to CAS3+ via ISTA-P.
	Native firmware.
	RealOEM ID
	Often listed as "Exchange CAS3"
	Listed as "Exchange CAS3" (Superseded part #'s)
	Forensic Check:
* If the car is an E70 X5 or E71 X6, it is almost guaranteed to be CAS3+.
* If the car is an E90 328i (2009+), it is CAS3+.
* If the car is an early E60 525i (2004), it is likely CAS2 or CAS3 (Base).

3. RealOEM Part Number Forensics
Use these prefixes to identify the system on RealOEM.com (Group 61 - Vehicle Electrical System).
CAS Family (Under Steering Column)
* CAS2: 61 35 6 943... (White Box)
* CAS3: 61 35 6 943... / 61 35 9 147... (Black or White Box)
* CAS4: 61 35 9... (Black Box, roughly 6" x 4")
   * Identifier: Look for Part # 61.35-9 395 656 (The universal replacement CAS4+).
   * Visual: Diagram shows module without a key slot.
FEM Family (Passenger Kick Panel)
* FEM: 61 35 9...
   * Common Numbers: 61.35-9 366 409, 61.35-9 868 380.
   * Visual: Large black module with many fuses directly on it.
   * Scrape Logic: If the description says "Front Electronic Module" and lists fuses F1-F10 on the unit, it is FEM.
BDC Family (Passenger Kick Panel)
* BDC (Gen 1): 61 35 9... or 61 35 8...
   * Common Numbers: 61.35-9 344..., 61.35-8 801 723.
   * Visual: Physically larger than FEM. No "REM" (Rear Electronic Module) listed in the car's topology (except some X5s).
* BDC2 (G-Series): 61 35 5... (Newer numbering)
   * Identifier: Often labeled "Body Domain Controller" with a white label containing a QR code.
   * Toyota: Part numbers on the Supra BDC will include the BMW 61 35... string in small print.

Comprehensive Analysis of Automotive Remote Entry Systems: FCC ID Compatibility, Cryptographic Architecture, and Interoperability of Twelve Select Identifiers
Executive Summary
The automotive security landscape is a complex ecosystem defined by the intersection of radio frequency (RF) engineering, cryptographic protocols, and proprietary manufacturing standards. This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of twelve specific Federal Communications Commission (FCC) identifiers: AB01602T, ABO0302T, ACJ8D8E24A04, AVL-B01T, IT7-RK-500TX, IT7RK700NR, LHJ009, NYOSYEC4TX1611, TQ8-FOB-4F03, TQ8-FOB-4F33, TQ8-RKE-3F01, and TQ8-RKE-4F21. These identifiers, while seemingly disparate, narrate the technological evolution of vehicle access control from the fixed-code systems of the early 1990s to the high-entropy, encrypted smart proximity keys of the 2020s.
Our research dissects the precise vehicle compatibility, frequency modulation, and transponder chip architecture for each identifier. A primary focus is placed on the evolution of Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) systems, tracing the trajectory from the 315 MHz standard dominant in North American General Motors (GM) vehicles of the late 20th century to the 433 MHz and 434 MHz protocols increasingly adopted by Asian manufacturers (Hyundai, Kia) for global platform unification. Furthermore, this report investigates cross-compatibility nuances, such as the interchangeability of GM flip keys, the critical distinction between "Memory 1" and "Memory 2" remotes in luxury Cadillac platforms, and the dual-band architecture of modern smart keys.
The analysis reveals that while FCC IDs provide a regulatory fingerprint for the transmitter, full compatibility is often determined by the underlying transponder logic (e.g., Philips ID46 vs. HITAG 3) and Body Control Module (BCM) firmware versions. The following sections provide a granular breakdown of each ID, supported by verified data points and technical specifications.
1. Evolution of Automotive RF Protocols: A Comparative Overview
To understand the specific functionalities and limitations of the twelve analyzed FCC IDs, one must first contextualize them within the broader history of automotive radio frequency regulation. The selected identifiers span over three decades of automotive engineering, representing three distinct eras of security technology.
1.1 The 315 MHz Era (Legacy North America)
Several identifiers in this dataset—specifically AB01602T, ABO0302T, and LHJ009—operate on the 315 MHz band. For nearly thirty years, this frequency was the de facto standard for North American automotive manufacturers, including General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler.
* Regulatory Context: The choice of 315 MHz was driven largely by United States regulations. The FCC allocated this band for unlicensed low-power communication under Part 15 rules, avoiding interference with military and emergency bands utilized in other regions.
* Propagation Characteristics: 315 MHz signals offer reasonable penetration through obstacles, such as garage walls or heavy purse linings, due to their longer wavelength compared to higher frequency alternatives. However, this band became increasingly crowded with consumer electronics, leading to potential signal collision issues in dense urban environments.
* Security Architecture: Early implementations represented by identifiers like ABO0302T relied on simple rolling code algorithms. These systems transmitted a pseudo-random number generated by a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) that incremented with each button press. While an improvement over fixed codes, they lacked the bidirectional challenge-response mechanisms found in modern keys. Later iterations, such as AVL-B01T, integrated high-security transponders while maintaining the legacy 315 MHz carrier wave for backward compatibility with established receiver networks in the US market.
1.2 The Shift to 433/434 MHz (Global Standardization)
The dataset highlights a definitive pivot in Asian manufacturing (Hyundai/Kia) and later global platforms toward the 433.92 MHz spectrum (often rounded to 433 or 434 MHz in technical literature). Identifiers such as TQ8-FOB-4F33 and NYOSYEC4TX1611 exemplify this shift.
* Globalization Drivers: The 433 MHz band is the standard for ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) applications in Region 1 (Europe, Africa, Middle East) and parts of Asia. As manufacturers like Hyundai and Kia moved toward "World Car" platforms—where a single vehicle architecture is sold globally with minimal changes—standardizing on 433 MHz allowed for supply chain unification. Instead of sourcing 315 MHz receivers for North America and 433 MHz for Europe, a single component set could be deployed.
* Operational Implications: For locksmiths and technicians, this transition introduces a critical point of failure in servicing. Visually identical remotes may operate on 315 MHz for the domestic US market and 433 MHz for export markets, or vice versa, depending on the specific model year and OEM supplier changes. For instance, the Hyundai Accent utilizes TQ8-RKE-3F01 (315 MHz) in certain years, while its platform mates migrated to 433 MHz.
1.3 The 313.8 MHz Niche (Honda/Acura)
A notable outlier in the dataset is the Acura identifier ACJ8D8E24A04. While often categorized broadly as "315 MHz" in general summaries, precise technical documentation confirms that Honda and Acura systems frequently operate on 313.8 MHz. This slight offset was an intentional design choice by Honda engineers to isolate their RKE systems from the noise floor of standard 315 MHz devices, theoretically improving signal reliability and range for their premium vehicles.


 Image 2. General Motors Legacy Systems (1991–2005)
The General Motors (GM) ecosystem from the early 1990s through the mid-2000s utilized a robust, if now antiquated, series of 315 MHz remotes. These systems were characterized by distinct "Driver 1" and "Driver 2" memory settings, a feature heavily marketed in luxury divisions like Cadillac and Oldsmobile to convey a sense of personalized luxury.
2.1 FCC ID: AB01602T (Cadillac Luxury Series)
The identifier AB01602T represents the pinnacle of GM's mid-90s RKE technology, designed specifically for the Cadillac K-body and G-body platforms.
* Frequency and Modulation: 315 MHz.
* Chip Architecture: This remote is a "Non-Transponder" unit. In this era, the immobilizer function—if present—was typically handled by the VATS (Vehicle Anti-Theft System) resistor pellet embedded in the ignition key blade, or a Pass-Key II system. The remote fob itself contained no transponder chip for engine starting; its sole purpose was door lock actuation and trunk release.
* Vehicle Compatibility:
   * Cadillac Deville: 1996 - 1997
   * Cadillac Eldorado: 1996 - 1997
   * Cadillac Seville: 1996 - 1997
   * Cadillac Catera: 1996 - 1999
* The "Driver Memory" Distinction: A critical technical nuance for AB01602T is its integration with the vehicle's memory module. These remotes were sold in matched pairs, often labeled on the rear casing as "1" or "2".
   * Memory 1: Associated with Part Numbers 16259819 or 16183016.
   * Memory 2: Associated with Part Numbers 16259829 or 16196066. * When the "Unlock" button is pressed on a Memory 1 remote, the Body Control Module (BCM) triggers a recall of the driver's seat position, side mirror angles, and radio station presets associated with Driver 1. This functionality requires that the correct remote be paired to the correct memory slot in the receiver. While the FCC ID AB01602T is legally certified for the RF transmission of both variants, the specific data packet sent (the rolling code payload) differs between the "Driver 1" and "Driver 2" hardware units to facilitate this feature.
2.2 FCC ID: ABO0302T (GM Large Body Platforms)
Moving further back in the timeline, the ABO0302T identifier serves the "H-body" and "C-body" platforms that defined GM's large sedan dominance in the early 1990s.
* Frequency: 315 MHz.
* Vehicle Compatibility:
   * Oldsmobile 98: 1991 - 1995
   * Oldsmobile 88: 1992 - 1995
   * Pontiac Bonneville: 1992 - 1995
   * Buick LeSabre: 1991 - 1995
   * Buick Park Avenue: 1991 - 1995
   * Oldsmobile Aurora: 1995
* Interchangeability and Variants: The ID ABO0302T is frequently cross-referenced with ABO0303T. In GM's parts database, these IDs often cover the same vehicle applications but may differ in button configuration (e.g., 3-button vs. 4-button with trunk release). Like the Cadillac remote, these units often featured memory functionality (Driver 1/2) depending on the trim level of the vehicle (e.g., Bonneville SSEi vs. SE). The programming for these vehicles is generally not onboard; it typically requires grounding a specific pin in the OBD-I connector or using a Tech 1 scan tool.
2.3 FCC ID: LHJ009 (The Saturn L-Series Anomaly)
The LHJ009 identifier is unique to the Saturn brand, specifically the L-Series, which was built on the GM2900 platform—a heavily modified version of the Opel Vectra B platform.
* Frequency: 315 MHz.
* Vehicle Compatibility:
   * Saturn L-Series (L100, L200, L300, LS, LS1, LS2): 2000 - 2005.
* Technical Constraints: Unlike many GM remotes of the 2000s that could be programmed by the owner (cycling the ignition key), the LHJ009 system is explicitly noted as "not onboard programmable". It requires a Tech 2 diagnostic tool or a compatible locksmith programmer to interface with the BCM. This reflects the European electronic architecture inherited from Opel, which generally favored dealer-controlled security over user-accessible programming.
* Button Configuration: Standard 4-button layout (Lock, Unlock, Trunk, Panic).
3. General Motors Modern Flip Keys (2010–2022)
The transition to the "High Security" era for GM is marked by the introduction of the laser-cut keyway (HU100) and the integration of the remote into the key head, creating the "Flip Key" or "Switchblade Key." The primary identifier for this era is AVL-B01T.
3.1 FCC ID: AVL-B01T (The "Super Key" of the 2010s)
The AVL-B01T (often labeled as AVL-B01T1AC on the shell) is arguably one of the most ubiquitous remotes in the modern automotive landscape. It represents a massive consolidation effort by GM to utilize a single RF architecture across its diverse lineup of sedans, SUVs, and compacts.
* Frequency: 315 MHz.
* Chip Architecture: Philips ID46 (PCF7937E). This is a cryptographic transponder that uses a "shadow" challenge-response mechanism. The vehicle's immobilizer coil energizes the chip, which then calculates a response based on a secret key. This high-security chip is integrated directly onto the remote's circuit board (PCB), unlike older keys where the chip was a separate glass or carbon pill in the plastic head.
* Manufacturer: The "AVL" code indicates manufacture by Valeo, a major French automotive supplier.
* Vehicle Compatibility Network: The scope of this key is vast, covering the GM Theta, Delta II, and Gamma II platforms.
   * Chevrolet Camaro: 2010 - 2016
   * Chevrolet Equinox: 2010 - 2019
   * Chevrolet Cruze: 2011 - 2016
   * Chevrolet Sonic: 2012 - 2017
   * Chevrolet Malibu: 2013 - 2016
   * Chevrolet Trax: 2015 - 2020
   * Chevrolet Impala: 2014 - 2020
   * Buick Encore: 2013 - 2022
   * Buick Regal: 2011 - 2017
   * Buick Verano: 2012 - 2016
   * GMC Terrain: 2010 - 2022
* The OHT vs. AVL Conflict: A significant point of confusion in the aftermarket is the relationship between AVL-B01T and OHT01060512.
   * OHT01060512 is manufactured by Strattec, GM's primary lock supplier.
   * AVL-B01T is manufactured by Valeo.
   * Technically, these remotes operate on the same 315 MHz frequency and utilize the same ID46 chip logic. For many vehicles, such as the Chevrolet Equinox and Camaro, they are functionally interchangeable. However, certain vehicle BCM firmware versions are sensitive to the manufacturer ID broadcast by the remote. While aftermarket "universal" GM flip keys often combine these protocols, OEM purists maintain separate inventories to ensure 100% successful programming.
* Platform Compatibility Insight: The sheer breadth of the AVL-B01T's compatibility—from the subcompact Sonic to the muscle car Camaro—illustrates GM's platform sharing strategy. By standardizing the BCM security handshake across the Delta (Cruze) and Zeta (Camaro) platforms, GM significantly reduced component complexity.
4. Daewoo / Chevrolet Legacy (1998–2010)
The dataset includes two identifiers that bridge the gap between Daewoo's independent operations and its absorption into GM (GM Korea), offering a window into the transitional period of Korean automotive exports.
4.1 FCC ID: IT7-RK-500TX (Daewoo Legacy)
* Frequency: ~314/315 MHz.
* System Type: RK-500 Keyless Entry System. The "TX" suffix explicitly denotes "Transmitter," a naming convention common in early Asian import electronics.
* Vehicle Compatibility: This remote is specific to the "Big Three" Daewoo models sold in the US market prior to the brand's bankruptcy and exit:
   * Daewoo Leganza: 1999 - 2002
   * Daewoo Lanos: 1999 - 2002
   * Daewoo Nubira: 2000 - 2002
* Chip: Generally non-transponder for the remote itself. The immobilizer system, if installed on these models, typically utilized a separate glass transponder in the key head, disjointed from the remote entry circuitry.
4.2 FCC ID: IT7RK700NR (The Aveo Connection)
* Frequency: 315 MHz.
* Grantee Code Insight: The "IT7" grantee code belongs to Daewoo Precision Industries, confirming the lineage of the vehicle it serves.
* Vehicle Compatibility:
   * Chevrolet Aveo: 2004 - 2010.
* Context: The Chevrolet Aveo was a rebadged Daewoo Kalos (T200 platform). Despite wearing a Chevrolet Bowtie, the electronics remained pure Daewoo. The IT7RK700NR is a remote head key (the remote buttons are on the key head), but sources indicate the US market version often contained "No Chip". This suggests that the US Aveo models of this era often relied solely on the mechanical key cut and the remote entry, omitting the immobilizer transponder found in European or Canadian variants, or that the immobilizer system was a separate module not integrated into the remote PCB.
5. Hyundai & Kia: The Smart Key Evolution (2012–2023)
The identifiers from the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group demonstrate the most dramatic technological progression in the dataset, moving from basic RKE to sophisticated Smart Key systems involving high-bit encryption and dual-band communication.
5.1 FCC ID: TQ8-RKE-3F01 (Hyundai Accent RKE)
* Frequency: 315 MHz.
* System Type: Standard RKE (Remote Keyless Entry). This is not a smart key; it requires a mechanical key turn to start the engine.
* Vehicle Compatibility:
   * Hyundai Accent: 2012 - 2014.
* Regional Frequency Conflict: It is crucial to note that while the TQ8-RKE-3F01 is the 315 MHz variant for North America, the same physical shell is used for 434 MHz variants (often TQ8-RKE-4F14) in other markets. Technicians must verify the FCC ID printed on the back to avoid frequency mismatch.
* Chip: Non-transponder RKE. The vehicle uses a mechanical key for ignition.
5.2 FCC ID: TQ8-FOB-4F03 (Hyundai Tucson Smart Key - ID46)
* Frequency: 433/434 MHz.
* Chip Architecture: Philips ID46 (PCF7953A). This remote represents the "middle generation" of Hyundai smart keys. It uses the ID46 protocol for the proximity handshake.
* Vehicle Compatibility:
   * Hyundai Tucson: 2014 - 2015.
* System Function: This is a Proximity / Smart Key (Push-to-Start). It allows the user to unlock the door by touching the handle and start the car while the key remains in the pocket.
5.3 FCC ID: TQ8-FOB-4F33 (Hyundai Palisade Smart Key - ID47)
* Frequency: 433/434 MHz.
* Chip Architecture: HITAG 3 / NCF2951 (ID47). This represents the modern standard for high-security smart keys. The HITAG 3 protocol offers significantly higher data throughput and entropy compared to ID46, enabling faster authentication and more secure encryption keys.
* Vehicle Compatibility:
   * Hyundai Palisade: 2020 - 2022.
* Dual-Band Architecture: The Physics of Proximity: To understand how the TQ8-FOB-4F33 functions, one must recognize its dual-band nature. While the FCC ID certifies the 433 MHz UHF (Ultra High Frequency) transmitter used for long-range commands (locking/unlocking from a distance), the key also contains a 3D Low-Frequency (LF) antenna coil tuned to 125 kHz.
   * The Handshake: When the driver presses the "Start" button, the car's LF antennas ping the cabin environment at 125 kHz. The key fob picks up this signal via its internal coil, wakes up, processes the challenge using the HITAG 3 chip, and transmits the encrypted response back to the car via the 433 MHz UHF link. This complex interplay ensures the key is physically inside the car before the engine can fire.
5.4 FCC ID: TQ8-RKE-4F21 (Kia Sedona Flip Key)
* Frequency: 433 MHz.
* Form Factor: 6-Button Flip Key (Lock, Unlock, Left Sliding Door, Right Sliding Door, Hatch, Panic).
* Vehicle Compatibility:
   * Kia Sedona: 2015 - 2018.
* Transponder Configuration: A critical distinction for this unit is that the remote circuit board (the part governed by the FCC ID) is Non-Transponder. The immobilizer chip is separate from the RKE board, often located in the plastic head of the flip key mechanism. This means a locksmith can program the remote entry functions (doors/sliders) independently of the engine immobilizer programming.
5.5 FCC ID: NYOSYEC4TX1611 (Kia Rio Flip Key - DST80)
* Frequency: 433 MHz.
* Chip Architecture: Texas Instruments 4D-60 80-Bit (DST80).
* Vehicle Compatibility:
   * Kia Rio: 2018 - 2023.
* The Supplier Divergence: This key highlights a supply chain divergence within the Hyundai-Kia group. While the Tucson and Palisade use NXP/Philips chips (ID46, ID47), the Rio utilizes a Texas Instruments (TI) solution. This implies that different tier-1 suppliers are used for different vehicle segments. The DST80 chip uses a 40-bit or 80-bit encryption key and is physically integrated onto the remote PCB in this flip key design.
* Part Numbers: Commonly associated with OEM Part Numbers 95430-H9850 or 95430-H9700.
6. Acura Smart Entry System
6.1 FCC ID: ACJ8D8E24A04 (Acura RL)
* Frequency: 313.8 MHz (often rounded to 314 MHz in snippets).
* Chip: Philips ID46.
* Vehicle Compatibility:
   * Acura RL: 2005 - 2013.
* The "Credit Card" Smart Key: The Acura RL was one of the first vehicles to introduce a keyless access system (Keyless Access System - KAS) to the Japanese luxury market in the US. The earlier versions of this system used a distinctive "credit card" style fob, later evolving into a more traditional smart fob.
* Memory Linking: Similar to the Cadillac remotes, the Acura RL fobs are strictly linked to Driver 1 and Driver 2 profiles. The FCC ID ACJ8D8E24A04 covers the RF transmission, but the Part Number (72147-SJA-A01 for Driver 1, 72147-SJA-A11 for Driver 2) determines the memory recall signal sent to the car.
7. Technical Synthesis: The Master Compatibility Matrix

	8. Conclusion
This exhaustive technical analysis confirms that the regulatory fingerprint provided by an FCC ID is merely the starting point for determining automotive key compatibility. The twelve identifiers studied here reveal a clear technological narrative:
1. The Transponder Divergence: We observe a critical bifurcation in transponder technology among Asian manufacturers. While Hyundai utilized Philips ID46 for the Tucson (TQ8-FOB-4F03) and migrated to HITAG 3 (ID47) for the Palisade (TQ8-FOB-4F33), Kia's Rio platform (NYOSYEC4TX1611) adopted Texas Instruments DST80 architecture. This underscores the necessity for locksmiths to maintain a diverse inventory of programming interfaces.
2. Frequency Regionalization: A distinct pattern emerges regarding signal frequency. The older GM (AB01602T) and transitional GM (AVL-B01T) keys adhere strictly to 315 MHz, a frequency historically allocated for North America. In contrast, modern Hyundai/Kia keys have migrated to 433 MHz, aligning with European ISM standards to streamline global production.
3. High-Interchangeability Clusters: The AVL-B01T stands out as a "Super Key," demonstrating GM's successful component consolidation strategy. Its compatibility across the Camaro, Equinox, Cruze, and Trax makes it a cornerstone of modern inventory for automotive security professionals.
For automotive technicians, the data emphasizes that successful key generation relies on a triangulation of FCC ID, Frequency, and Transponder Chip. Reliance on visual matching alone is insufficient, particularly with the 315/433 MHz splits in models like the Hyundai Accent and the memory-specific variations in legacy Cadillac systems.

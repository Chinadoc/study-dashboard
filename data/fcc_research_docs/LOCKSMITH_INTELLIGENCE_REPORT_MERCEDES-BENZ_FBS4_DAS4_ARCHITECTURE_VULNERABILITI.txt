LOCKSMITH INTELLIGENCE REPORT: MERCEDES-BENZ FBS4 (DAS4) ARCHITECTURE, VULNERABILITIES, AND LIMITATIONS (2019–2026)
1. CRITICAL REALITY CHECK - WARNINGS
1.1 The "Impossible" Wall of 2020+ Platforms
The automotive security landscape underwent a seismic shift with the full maturation of the Mercedes-Benz Fahrberechtigungssystem 4 (FBS4) architecture. While the industry successfully reverse-engineered the preceding FBS3 system—standard from roughly 1998 to 2014—FBS4 represents a fundamental departure in cryptographic philosophy that currently renders "All Keys Lost" (AKL) scenarios virtually impenetrable for the aftermarket on models produced between 2019 and 2026.
For the Vehicle Security Professional (VSP) operating in 2025/2026, specifically regarding the W206 (C-Class), W223 (S-Class), and facelifted W213/W167 platforms, the operational reality is stark and unforgiving: There is currently no publicly available aftermarket tool capable of calculating a key password from the Electronic Ignition Switch (EIS/EZS) via OBDII or bench connection for an All Keys Lost situation. Claims to the contrary by hardware vendors often conflate "FBS4 Support"—which typically refers to module renewal or adaptation of used control units—with "Key Calculation," the process of generating a key credential from scratch. This conflation is the primary source of financial loss and liability for independent locksmiths today.1
The critical distinction lies in the server-side dependency of the system. Unlike previous generations where the mathematical logic for key generation was contained within the vehicle's modules (allowing for extraction and calculation), FBS4 relies on a pre-computed digital handshake established at the factory. The locksmith industry faces a hard stop: without access to the specific proprietary hash files generated by Mercedes-Benz's central servers in Germany, the creation of a working key file is mathematically infeasible with current brute-force capabilities.
1.2 The Risk of "Bricking" Control Modules
The danger of attempting to circumvent these protections cannot be overstated. Locksmiths attempting to force legacy FBS3 methods or early FBS4 exploits on late-model vehicles (2020+) risk triggering catastrophic data corruption. The FBS4 architecture utilizes strict counter mechanisms within the EIS and Engine Control Unit (ECU). Unauthorized read attempts, particularly those employing aggressive voltage injection (glitch attacks) common in older key programming tools, can trigger "anti-tamper" modes in the EIS. Once triggered, the module permanently locks, requiring a replacement cost that often exceeds $1,500 USD.2
Furthermore, the electrical architecture of modern mild-hybrid (48V) EQ Boost models (W206, W223) introduces new volatility. Disconnecting the battery or attempting bench programming without specialized voltage support can cause a desynchronization between the 48V Starter Generator and the ECU. This desynchronization manifests as a "Start Enable Not Issued" error (DTC P051300), a condition that effectively immobilizes the vehicle. Recovery from this state often requires Xentry (the official dealer diagnostic tool) with valid online credentials to perform a "Teach-in" of the drive authorization system, a capability most independent locksmiths lack.4
1.3 The NASTF and TRP Mandate
Compounding the technical barriers are strict administrative hurdles. Mercedes-Benz enforces one of the most rigorous Theft Relevant Part (TRP) policies in the automotive sector. Since 2020, access to TRP coding data has been severely restricted, even for VSPs registered with the National Automotive Service Task Force (NASTF). Keys for FBS4 vehicles are rarely, if ever, sold "blank" to independent parties. Instead, they are pre-coded to the VIN at logistics centers (e.g., Fort Worth, Texas, for the US market) before shipment.
This creates a perilous trap for the uninformed locksmith: purchasing "Virgin" FBS4 keys from third-party marketplaces (e.g., eBay, Alibaba) for 2020+ models is essentially purchasing inert plastic. These keys require an initial hash file to be written to their secure memory sectors to function—a file that can currently only be generated by the Mercedes-Benz backend. Without proprietary, non-public methods for writing this initial data, these blank keys cannot be enrolled in the vehicle.5
2. FBS4 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
2.1 The Philosophy of "Server-Side" Security
To understand the limitations of the aftermarket, one must understand the architectural shift from "local" to "server-side" security. In the FBS3 era, the "Master Key" logic was contained within the Motorola or NEC processors of the EIS. Tools like the VVDI MB Tool or Autel IM608 could query the EIS, extract the SSID and a partial hash, and then use a server farm to mathematically "guess" the password. This was possible because the validation logic was self-contained within the car.
FBS4 eliminates this vulnerability by utilizing a rolling authentication token that is validated against the Mercedes-Benz backend server during the initial programming phase at the factory. The system creates a unique 128-bit key track that pairs the EIS, ECU, TCU, and ESL (if present) permanently. Once this "marriage" is complete, the components communicate using a proprietary encrypted language that cannot be sniffed or replicated without the initial "Blue Key" (Workshop Key) data. This initial data is never exposed to the OBDII port and is not stored in plain text within the modules, rendering traditional extraction methods obsolete.1


  



2.2 Component Interdependency (The "Start Chain")
The strength of the FBS4 system lies in its rigid component interdependency. A successful engine start requires a valid "Challenge-Response" sequence across the entire drivetrain, not just the ignition switch.
1. Key (Transponder): The process begins with the key sending an encrypted request via 433MHz (or 315MHz in older legacy regions) or Infrared (IR) if inserted into the slot. This signal contains the unique track ID and a rolling code.
2. EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch - N73): The EIS receives the signal and validates the key's Hash against its internal database. If valid, it sends a "Wake Up" signal to the CAN bus. Crucially, the EIS also manages the "Rail" counters, ensuring that a cloned key (if one could be made) would eventually fall out of sync with the vehicle's rolling code counter.
3. ELV/ESL (Electronic Steering Lock): In modern platforms like the W206 and W223, the physical steering lock is frequently replaced by an electronic inhibitor integrated into the transmission or a simplified locking mechanism. Where present, it must unlock before Terminal 15 (Ignition) is energized.
4. Gateway (ZGW): The Central Gateway acts as a firewall. In 2021+ models, this component is secured with SFD-like protection (Security Access), requiring online authentication to even read certain data blocks, further blinding aftermarket tools.
5. ECU & TCU: Both the Engine Control Unit and the Transmission Control Unit (7G-Tronic, 9G-Tronic, or 8G-DCT) must return a valid "Challenge-Response" to the EIS. If the TCU does not validate—for example, if a used transmission from another vehicle is installed without proper personalization—the vehicle may crank but will not shift out of Park, or may not crank at all. This "Drive Authorization" check is the final barrier that prevents simple component swapping.1
2.3 The "Virgin" State Myth and Reality
A prevalent misconception in the locksmith community is that one can simply "virginize" (reset to factory state) a used FBS4 module and reprogram it, solving the key issue. While advanced engineering firms like Abrites have achieved this for specific control modules—such as VGS4-NAG2 transmission controllers or MED17 engine computers—this capability does not extend to keys.
You can virginize an ECU to accept an existing authorized key, but you cannot virginize a used FBS4 key to work on a new car. The "Write Once" nature of the NEC chips inside the key fobs prevents rewriting the critical security sectors once they are locked to a VIN. This means a used key from a W223 cannot be unlocked and reprogrammed to a different W223 using standard aftermarket methods.10
3. VEHICLE COVERAGE MATRIX (C-Class, E-Class, S-Class, SUVs, etc.)
This matrix defines the boundaries of aftermarket capability for models produced between 2019 and 2026. It is crucial to distinguish between "Supported" (meaning a specialized tool like Abrites or Autel IM608 with G-Box can perform the action) and "Dealer Only" (implying no public solution exists).
3.1 Chassis-Specific Analysis
W206 (C-Class) / W223 (S-Class) - The "Star3" Architecture
The W206 and W223 platforms, introduced roughly in late 2020/2021, represent the "Star3" electrical architecture. This moves beyond standard CAN bus to extensive use of Automotive Ethernet and FlexRay for high-speed data transfer. The EIS in these vehicles is often integrated into a central compute cluster or heavily firewalled.
* Status 2025/2026: No aftermarket tool (Autel, Xhorse, Abrites, CGDI) can calculate a key password for these cars.
* Module Replacement: There is partial success in module replacement (swapping a bad ECU for a used one), but this strictly requires the presence of an original, working key to authorize the swap. In an All Keys Lost scenario, these vehicles are exclusively the domain of the dealership.10
W213 (E-Class) / W238 (E-Coupe) - Facelift Era
The facelifted W213 (2020+) presents a trap for locksmiths. While early W213 models (2016-2019) might occasionally be vulnerable to certain bench read exploits depending on the specific ECU (e.g., MED17.7.2), the 2020+ models moved to updated firmware and hardware revisions (often Bosch MG1/MD1 ECUs) that closed these backdoors.
* Key Programming: Add Key is generally impossible via OBD. All Keys Lost is impossible.
* Module Renewal: Supported for Engine and Transmission control units using bench tools like Autel G-Box3 or Abrites MN032/MN034, but again, this does not create a key.15
W167 (GLE/GLS) / W177 (A-Class) / W247 (B-Class)
These SUVs and compacts share the MBUX-generation architecture. They utilize the same advanced FBS4 protocols as the sedans.
* Limitations: Reports consistently confirm that Autel IM608 and similar tools fail to read password data even when the EIS is removed and connected on the bench. The "calculation" process hangs or fails because the algo is unknown.16

	4. KEY SPECIFICATIONS BY MODEL
Understanding the hardware is critical to avoiding the purchase of incompatible inventory. The physical appearance of keys has changed significantly in this generation.
4.1 Frequency and Signal Protocols
* 433 MHz Standardization: The vast majority of 2019+ models for both US and European markets utilize 433 MHz. The legacy 315 MHz frequency, which was common in older US models, has been largely phased out in the FBS4 era to unify global production standards. Locksmiths should be wary of stocking 315 MHz keys for 2020+ vehicles unless specifically verified by VIN.18
* Ultra-Wideband (UWB): The W223 S-Class and high-spec W206 C-Class models incorporate UWB technology for precise location tracking, essential for the advanced Keyless-Go and "Digital Key" features. This prevents relay attacks by measuring the time-of-flight of the signal. Aftermarket "Universal" keys (like the Xhorse XS series) often fail to emulate the UWB signal correctly. This results in a scenario where the transponder might start the car if placed in the emergency coil, but the Keyless-Go functions will fail, and the dashboard will constantly display "Key Not Detected" errors.21
4.2 Form Factors and FCC IDs
* The "S-Class" Fob (Gen 7):
   * Appearance: Distinctive rounded, pebble-like shape, finished in high-gloss black or white with silver metallic sides.
   * Models: W223 (S-Class), W206 (C-Class), W232 (SL), EQS (V297), EQE (V295).
   * FCC ID: Common identifiers include IYZMS5 or NBGDM3, depending on the specific supplier (Huf or Continental) and region. It is critical to note that these are not interchangeable with the older "shaped" keys or previous generations.
   * Part Numbers: Typically fall under the A223 905 xx xx series. These keys are heavily encrypted and VIN-locked.22
* The "E-Class" Fob (Gen 6):
   * Appearance: Traditional rectangular "fobik" shape but slimmer than the FBS3 generation, often featuring a matte finish or metal surround.
   * Models: Late W213, W167, W177, W247.
   * FCC ID: Frequently IYZDC12K. These are visually similar to older keys but internally incompatible.26
5. AFTERMARKET SOLUTIONS (Tools, Workarounds)
Despite the grim outlook for key programming, specialized tools are essential for module work, diagnostics, and the limited scope of repairs that remain possible.
5.1 Abrites (AVDI) - The Module Specialist
Abrites remains the market leader for FBS4 module manipulation, though they are careful to avoid claiming AKL capabilities for 2021+ cars. Their focus has shifted to keeping vehicles on the road via component replacement.
* License MN032 (DAS Manager for FBS4): This license allows for the reading of personalization data from working units and writing it to "Virgin" units. It is the backbone of independent repair for FBS4.
* License MN034 (FBS4 Personalization Expert): This is the critical tool for 2020+ maintenance. It enables the personalization of modules (ECU, TCU, DSM) without previously saved data, provided the module is virgin or can be set to virgin. This capability is vital for scenarios such as replacing a water-damaged ECU in a W206, where the original data is unrecoverable.8
* License MN038: Specifically designed for calibrating dashboards (IC223/IC177) in W206/W223. This is often required after a theft recovery or module swap to ensure mileage data synchronizes correctly without triggering tamper dots.14
5.2 Autel (IM608 Pro II / IM508S) - The Diagnostic Workhorse
Autel is the standard "workhorse" for older FBS3 and early FBS4 diagnostics but hits a hard functional wall with late FBS4 platforms.
* G-Box3 Utility: The G-Box3 adapter is essential for "All Keys Lost" on FBS3 vehicles and for reading ISN/Passwords on early FBS4 ECUs (Bosch MED17) on the bench. However, its utility diminishes significantly on 2020+ architectures.
* Known Limitations: Users consistently report failure when attempting to "Add Key" on 2021+ models (W213 facelift, W167). The tool will typically scan the system, fail to read the password via OBD, and eventually prompt the user to insert a dealer key. It is important to note that the Autel KM100 is explicitly unsupported for Mercedes-Benz key programming due to hardware limitations.2
5.3 Xhorse (VVDI Key Tool Plus) - The Renewal Tool
Xhorse provides excellent hardware for "virginizing" keys (unlocking used keys) if one possesses the necessary NEC adapter, but they cannot calculate the password for a W206/W223 vehicle to program that key.
* PCB Renewal: Xhorse is valuable for renewing older FBS4 keys (up to ~2018) so they can be re-programmed by a dealer or used in bench testing. However, they cannot write the encrypted track data for a 2022 model without the dealer server handshake. The tool is best utilized for hardware diagnostics and older chassis support.30


  



6. "USED KEY" ADAPTATION
6.1 The "Grey Market" of Key Renewal
Since new keys are strictly dealer-restricted, a significant "grey market" has emerged for "Renewed" or "Unlocked" OEM keys.
* Feasibility: It is physically possible to desolder the NEC processor from a used W206/W223 key and erase the memory using a specialized programmer (like VVDI PROG with an NEC adapter). This process resets the key to a "blank" state, theoretically ready for programming.33
* The Catch: A blank key is useless without the specific file to write to it. Since independent locksmiths cannot calculate the key file from the car, renewed keys can only be programmed if you have a dealer account and the ability to perform an online "Teach-in" process. Without this online access, a renewed key is effectively a blank slate with no instructions. Independent locksmiths cannot simply "write" a key file to these blanks as they did with FBS3.9
6.2 PCB Swapping (The "Brain Transplant")
In scenarios where a key is physically damaged (crushed, water damage, or broken casing) but the chip itself is intact, a "Brain Transplant" is often the only viable aftermarket solution.
* Technique: A skilled technician can transplant the NEC microcontroller from the damaged board to a healthy donor PCB of the exact same FCC ID and part number. This requires precision soldering skills.
* Outcome: If successful, this preserves the digital identity of the key, allowing it to start the car immediately without any programming. This is currently the only way an independent locksmith can "restore" a W206/W223 key functionality without dealer involvement, provided the original chip is alive.33
7. MECHANICAL KEY / EMERGENCY ACCESS
7.1 Lishi Tool Compatibility
* HU64 (Legacy): This profile remains widely effective for trunk and door locks on W205, W213, and W463 models.
* New Profiles (High Security): Newer models may utilize tighter tolerances or modified keyways. While often still based on the HU64 geometry (sometimes referred to as HU126 in aftermarket catalogs), the keyway may be tighter.
* Lock Picking: The W206 and W223 locks are technically pickable with standard HU64 Lishi tools (2-in-1), but the physical access to the cylinder is the primary challenge due to handle design.35
7.2 The Flush Handle Challenge (W223/EQS)
The S-Class (W223) and EQS feature retractable flush door handles that present a unique barrier during lockout situations.
* Dead Battery Access: If the vehicle battery is dead, the handles will not extend electronically.
* Opening Procedure:
   1. Pivot the Handle: Apply manual pressure to the front part of the handle to pivot the rear section out (or press the rear to pivot the front, depending on the specific handle revision—always check the manual if possible, but generally, the key cylinder is at the rear).
   2. Locate the Cap: Once the handle is pivoted, locate the mechanical cylinder hidden underneath the decorative cap.
   3. Remove the Cap: Insert the emergency blade (or a non-marring tool) into the slot on the underside of the cap to pop it off. Note: These caps are painted to match the body and are fragile.
   4. Unlock: Insert the key into the exposed cylinder and turn to unlock.
Warning: Rough handling can break the plastic clips of the cap, leading to a replacement cost of over $200 USD plus painting.38
8. DEALER REFERRAL GUIDANCE
When you inevitably encounter the "FBS4 Wall," guiding the customer to the dealer with professionalism builds trust and preserves your reputation. You must act as a triage point.
8.1 Service Triage Protocol
To efficiently manage customer expectations and avoid wasted service calls, locksmiths should adopt a triage protocol for Mercedes-Benz inquiries:
   1. Check Year: If the vehicle is 2020 or newer, proceed with extreme caution.
   2. Check Model: If it is a W206, W223, or facelifted model, acknowledge the high probability of dealer exclusivity.
   3. Check Status:
   * All Keys Lost (AKL): If the vehicle is a 2020+ model with no working keys, the only viable path is a dealer referral. There is no safe aftermarket solution.
   * Add Key: If the customer has one working key, there is a slim possibility of dealer-level "add key" services if you have online access, but for most independent locksmiths, this is still a dealer referral.
   * Lockout Only: You can provide entry services (pick and decode) but clearly communicate that you cannot generate a key to start the car.
8.2 The "Theft Relevant Part" (TRP) D1 Form
To order a key, the dealer is legally mandated—and strictly monitored by Mercedes-Benz corporate—to adhere to the TRP policy.
   1. Vehicle Presence: The car often must be physically present at the dealership to sync the key, especially for the "Teach-in" of the rail sensor and counter synchronization.
   2. Required Documentation: The customer must present the Original Title or Registration and a matching Government ID. Photocopies are typically rejected.
   3. NASTF SDRM Role: In the US, independent Vehicle Security Professionals (VSPs) can theoretically order TRPs via the NASTF Secure Data Release Model (SDRM). However, for Mercedes keys, the process is often routed to a partnering dealership anyway due to the pre-coding requirement. The VSP acts as the verifier of the customer's identity, but the dealer supplies the actual hardware. The VSP cannot simply buy a blank key and program it themselves.6
8.3 Cost Expectations (2025)
Locksmiths should prepare the customer for the financial reality of a dealer key replacement:
   * Smart Key Fob: $600 - $900 USD.
   * Emergency Blade: $80 - $150 USD.
   * Programming Labor: $200 - $400 USD (typically 1-2 hours of labor).
   * Total: Expect quotes ranging from $900 to $1,500 for a single key replacement on a W223/W206. This sticker shock is normal for the platform.42
9. FUTURE OUTLOOK
9.1 Will FBS4 Be Cracked?
The cryptographic community views FBS4 as robust. Unlike FBS3, which had a flaw in the pseudo-random number generator that allowed for calculation, FBS4 uses industry-standard AES-128 (or higher) encryption. A "crack" is unlikely to come from brute force. Future breakthroughs will likely stem from:
   1. Leak of Private Keys: A hypothetical data breach at Daimler that exposes the private signing keys.
   2. Side-Channel Attacks: Advanced power analysis attacks on the EIS hardware itself, though this would require physical removal and extreme expertise, negating the convenience of OBD tools.
   3. Dealer Tool Emulation: Chinese engineers successfully emulating the Xentry online handshake. This is an ongoing battle, with Mercedes frequently updating certificates to block unauthorized access.
Forecast: Do not expect a simple "plug-and-play" OBD programmer for W206/W223 keys before 2027/2028. The current "workarounds" involve costly module replacements and sophisticated bench work, not simple key generation.3
10. SUPPLEMENTAL RESOURCES
10.1 Essential Data Sources
   * MHH Auto / Digital Kaos: These underground forums are where the bleeding edge of "workarounds" (like module virginization files) are discussed. Note that the technical barrier to entry is high.
   * NASTF.org: The official source for TRP application forms and VSP registry updates. Crucial for US-based locksmiths to stay compliant.45
   * Abrites.com: The official source for updates on Module Renewal capabilities. They are often the first to release legitimate aftermarket solutions for component adaptation.10
10.2 Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) to Watch
   * P051300: "Start Enable Not Issued" - The classic indicator of an FBS4 mismatch or synchronization failure.
   * B2191: "The power supply of the steering lock is faulty" - Common in older W204/W212 platforms, but in FBS4 W205/W213, this usually indicates an internal EIS failure rather than a steering lock issue.

2019 Chevrolet Blazer Locksmith Intelligence Report: Critical Alerts, Architecture, Programming Pearls, FCC ID & Remote Data, Security Barriers, Tools & Procedures, Cross-Reference
Executive Summary: The Strategic Nexus of GM Security
The 2019 Chevrolet Blazer represents a definitive moment in the evolution of General Motors' vehicle security architecture, standing as the sophisticated apex of the Global A platform immediately prior to the fleet-wide transition to the cryptographically hardened, Over-the-Air (OTA) dependent Global B (Vehicle Intelligence Platform) architecture. For the automotive locksmith, the forensic analyst, and the security professional, this vehicle is not merely another entry in the catalog; it is a "high-stakes, high-reward" operational asset that demands a nuanced understanding of transitional technologies. It sits in a unique historical and technical window—modern enough to exclusively utilize high-frequency Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS) systems that command premium service pricing, yet utilizing an architecture that remains accessible to standard aftermarket programming protocols without the need for invasive proprietary bypasses.
This report serves as the definitive technical manual and strategic dossier for servicing the 2019 Blazer. It moves beyond the superficiality of basic key generation instructions to explore the forensic architecture of the vehicle, analyzing the C1XX platform, the nuances of the HYQ4EA remote ecosystem, the cryptographic distinctions of the Philips ID46 transponder protocols versus their successors, and the specific electromechanical vulnerabilities of the Shift-to-Park mechanism that frequently mimic immobilizer failures.
The operational profile of the 2019 Blazer is strictly defined by its Push-to-Start (Prox) configuration. There is no bladed ignition option for this model year, a design choice that signaled the end of the mechanical ignition era for GM’s mid-size SUV segment. The immobilizer system is built on the Philips ID46 (Hitag 2 Extended) protocol, operating at a standardized 433 MHz. While it predates the aggressive CAN-FD lockout seen in 2021+ GM SUVs such as the Tahoe and Yukon, it demands precise procedural adherence to avoid "sleep mode" lockouts or Body Control Module (BCM) desynchronization, particularly when battery voltage is compromised.
The insights contained herein are derived from a comprehensive analysis of field reports, technical service bulletins, and locksmith data clusters. We will explore the critical distinction between Global A and Global B architectures, dissect the "CAN-FD" myth regarding this model year, and provide an exhaustive guide to inventory management for the HYQ4EA remote series. Furthermore, we will delve into the mechanical redundancies of the HU100 high-security keyway and the specific "pocket" rituals required for successful transponder learning.
1. Vehicle Architecture: The C1XX Platform and Global A Analysis
Understanding the digital skeleton of the 2019 Blazer is a prerequisite to successful programming and diagnostic troubleshooting. The vehicle is constructed on the C1XX platform, a crossover-specific chassis architecture that shares its DNA with the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, Buick Enclave, and the Cadillac XT5. This shared lineage is not merely a matter of sheet metal; it dictates the placement of antennas, the logic of the Body Control Module (BCM), and the interchangeability of security components.
1.1 Global A vs. Global B: The Locksmith's Divide
The single most frequent and critical inquiry regarding modern General Motors vehicles in the locksmithing community is: "Is this vehicle Global A or Global B?" This distinction is binary and determines the entire operational workflow. Global A represents the standard established over the previous decade, allowing for standard OBD programming with reputable aftermarket tools. Global B, also known as the Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP), introduces encrypted gateways and a cybersecurity firewall that requires dealer-level authentication (Techline Connect) or specialized, expensive aftermarket bypasses to even attempt communication with the immobilizer system.
Status Confirmation: The 2019 Chevrolet Blazer is a Global A vehicle. However, it is essential to characterize it as the final evolution of this architecture, often termed "Global A Enhanced" or "High-Speed Global A." This means that while it does not possess the encrypted "seed and key" firewall that locks out tools on the 2021+ Tahoe, its modules are highly sophisticated and sensitive. They utilize high-speed GMLAN communications that are intolerant of voltage fluctuations or interruption.
The implication for programming is substantial. The success rate for the 2019 Blazer using aftermarket tools such as the Autel IM608, Smart Pro, or AutoProPad is exceptionally high, provided the technician adheres to protocol. The risk of "bricking" modules—a catastrophic failure where the BCM becomes unresponsive—is significantly lower than in Global B vehicles, but non-zero if battery voltage is neglected. Unlike the legacy "GM CAN" systems of the mid-2000s, this platform requires software modules specifically updated for "GM Prox 2017+."


  



1.2 The Role of the BCM and PEPS Module
In the 2019 Blazer, the Body Control Module (BCM) acts as the master gateway for the security system. It stores the known key identifiers and orchestrates communication with the Remote Control Door Lock Receiver (RCDLR). The interaction is a sophisticated dance of radio frequencies. When a user approaches the vehicle or attempts to start it, the system initiates a Low-Frequency (LF) challenge via antennas located in the center console, door handles, and trunk area. The key fob, upon receiving this LF wake-up signal, must respond via Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) at 433 MHz to the RCDLR.
This architecture creates specific failure modes that the locksmith must recognize. If the BCM detects a voltage fluctuation during the critical "Learn" process—such as when the Start/Stop button is pressed to finalize a key—it may abort the procedure to protect the EEPROM data. This abortion is often misdiagnosed by the technician as a "bad key" or "wrong frequency," leading to unnecessary parts replacement. Furthermore, if the vehicle displays "No Remote Detected" even with a new key placed in the programming pocket, the fault may lie not with the key, but with the console pocket antenna itself or the fuse powering the RCDLR. The BCM expects a specific signal strength from the pocket; if debris or a rubber mat interferes with the LF transmission, the handshake fails.
The BCM in the C1XX platform is also the control center for the vehicle's power management modes. It aggressively monitors battery state-of-charge. If the battery voltage dips below a set threshold (typically around 12.2V), the BCM enters a load-shedding mode which can disable non-essential programming functions. This is why connecting an external power supply is not merely a recommendation but a procedural requirement for professional servicing of the 2019 Blazer.
1.3 The "CAN-FD" Protocol Analysis
A significant source of confusion in the current market is the requirement for CAN-FD (Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate) adapters. The automotive industry, led by GM, began transitioning to this faster communication protocol to handle the massive data throughput required by modern safety and infotainment systems.
The critical question for the locksmith is: Does the 2019 Blazer require a CAN-FD adapter?
Based on extensive platform analysis, the 2019 Chevrolet Blazer does not inherently require a CAN-FD adapter for key programming. The CAN-FD protocol became the standard mandated interface on GM's Global B architecture, which rolled out primarily on 2021+ models like the Tahoe, Suburban, and Escalade. The 2019 Blazer, being a Global A platform vehicle, utilizes the standard High-Speed CAN lines (pins 6 and 14 on the OBDII port) and the Single Wire CAN (pin 1) for its communication.
However, while not required, owning and using a CAN-FD adapter (or a tool with built-in CAN-FD support like the Autel VCI V200) is a best practice. Some late-production 2019 models or those that have received extensive dealer firmware updates may utilize higher baud rates that legacy OBD adapters struggle to negotiate. The adapter ensures robust communication integrity, even if the protocol isn't strictly FD.
2. Remote Intelligence: FCC ID, Frequency, and Chip Forensics
The inventory strategy for the 2019 Blazer is specific and unforgiving. Unlike older GM vehicles that used 315 MHz frequencies, the C1XX platform has standardized on 433 MHz, aligning with global standards and allowing for better integration with Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) which often share the RCDLR receiver.
2.1 The HYQ4EA Ecosystem
The primary FCC ID for the 2019 Blazer is HYQ4EA. This remote identifier is the "golden ticket" for the locksmith, as it is shared across a valuable cluster of vehicles including the Chevrolet Traverse (2018-2020), Equinox (2020), Cruze (2018-2019), and Malibu (2019-2020).
Technical Specifications:
* FCC ID: HYQ4EA
* IC: 1551A-4EA
* Frequency: 433 MHz. Note: This is the most critical variable. The 315 MHz version, FCC ID HYQ4AA, looks physically identical but is electronically incompatible. Attempting to program an 'AA' remote to an 'EA' vehicle will result in failure.
* OEM Part Numbers (5-Button - Start/Stop/Hatch/Panic): 13529636, 13519188, 13584514, 13506669.
* OEM Part Numbers (3-Button - Lock/Unlock/Panic): 13529639, 13519177.
* Battery: CR2032.
The interchangeability of these part numbers is robust. A remote with part number 13529636 can typically be used in place of 13519188 without issue, provided the FCC ID matches. Furthermore, a 5-button remote can often be programmed to a lower-trim vehicle that originally came with a 3-button remote. The extra buttons (e.g., Remote Start or Hatch) simply will not function, but the lock, unlock, and start functions will operate correctly. This allows the locksmith to consolidate inventory by stocking the "fully loaded" 5-button version to cover all trim levels.
2.2 Transponder Chip Nuances: ID46 vs. ID49
There is significant confusion in the locksmith community regarding the chip type because GM transitioned technologies around this time. The 2019 Blazer utilizes a Philips ID46 (PCF795x / Hitag 2 Extended) transponder chip.
This distinction is vital because the newer 2021+ Chevy Tahoe and Suburban (Global B) vehicles use the NXP Hitag Pro (ID49) chip. Visually, the key fobs for a 2019 Blazer and a 2021 Tahoe are indistinguishable. They share the same shell design, the same button layout, and often the same logo. However, the internal architecture is completely different.
* ID46 (Blazer): Uses a specific challenge-response cryptographic exchange known as "Hitag 2 Extended." The BCM sends a random number, the key encrypts it using its secret key, and sends the result back.
* ID49 (Tahoe/Global B): Uses the much more advanced "Hitag Pro" or AES-128 encryption.
* The Conflict: If a locksmith attempts to program a Hitag Pro (ID49) remote to a 2019 Blazer, the BCM will issue an ID46 challenge. The ID49 chip will not understand the request or will respond in a format the BCM cannot interpret. The programming will fail, usually with a generic error message or a timeout.


  



2.3 The RPO Code "XL8" Indicator
To assist in identification, GM utilizes Regular Production Option (RPO) codes. For the 2019 Blazer, the relevant code to verify the remote frequency is XL8. This code indicates a 433 MHz remote entry system.
When sourcing used or refurbished keys, or when verifying the vehicle's system if the original keys are entirely lost, the locksmith should locate the Service Parts Identification (SPID) label. On the 2019 Blazer, this is often found in the glove box, under the rear cargo floor, or on the B-pillar in the form of a QR code. Scanning this code or reading the list will reveal the "XL8" designator.
* XL7: Indicates a 315 MHz System. This is rare or non-existent for the 2019 Blazer but is common on older Chevrolet Malibus or Cruzes.
* XL8: Indicates a 433 MHz System. This is the standard for the 2019 Blazer.
If the SPID label lists XL8, the locksmith must use the 433 MHz HYQ4EA remote. Attempting to program a 315 MHz remote will be futile as the RCDLR antenna is physically tuned to ignore that frequency band.
3. Programming Protocols: The Locksmith's Playbook
Programming the 2019 Blazer is a procedural exercise that rewards precision. The vehicle supports two primary methods of key enrollment: On-Board Programming (OBP) and OBD Programming via professional locksmith tools. Each has its specific utility, constraints, and operational windows.
3.1 On-Board Programming (The "DIY" Method)
The On-Board Programming method allows for key enrollment without the use of a diagnostic scan tool. However, it is critical to understand the limitations imposed by the vehicle's firmware. This method is generally only available to the end-user if they possess two currently working keys. If the user has zero keys or only one key, the "Add Key" OBP method is locked out to prevent unauthorized duplication by valets or temporary drivers.
Procedure for Adding a Key (Requires 2 Working Keys):
This is the "spare key" scenario.
   1. Preparation: Place the two existing, working keys in the front cupholder. This is the designated "pocket" location for the Blazer.
   2. Initiation: Insert the mechanical emergency blade of the new (unprogrammed) key into the driver's door lock cylinder.
   3. Trigger: Turn the key to the Unlock position 5 times within 10 seconds. This mechanical cycling signals the BCM to enter learn mode.
   4. Confirmation: The Driver Information Center (DIC) on the dashboard will display: REMOTE LEARN PENDING, PLEASE WAIT.
   5. Wait Cycle: The system will now initiate a security timer. While some older models required a 10-minute wait, the "Add Key" procedure with two authenticators present is often much faster. However, the official procedure allows for a wait of up to 10 minutes for the system to verify the crypto-keys of the existing fobs.
   6. Learning: Once the DIC indicates readiness (e.g., "Ready for Remote #3"), place the new key in the cupholder pocket.
   7. Finalization: Press the START/STOP button. The instrument cluster should flash, and the door locks may cycle, confirming the new key has been written to the BCM's memory.
Procedure for All Keys Lost (No Tools - The "30 Minute" Method):
This method is a legacy feature of the Global A architecture. While vital as a backup if a scan tool fails or is unavailable, it is inefficient for a professional workflow.
Constraint: This procedure wipes all previously programmed keys.
   1. Trigger: Turn the driver's door lock cylinder 5 times to the Unlock position within 10 seconds.
   2. Wait 1: The DIC displays Remote Learn Pending. Wait for 10 minutes.
   3. Action 1: The DIC will change to Press Engine Start Button to Learn. Press the Start button.
   4. Wait 2: The DIC returns to Remote Learn Pending. Wait for another 10 minutes.
   5. Action 2: Press the Start button again.
   6. Wait 3: Wait for a third and final 10 minutes.
   7. Action 3: Press the Start button. The system has now completed a 30-minute security delay, effectively proving that the person attempting to program the key has had physical possession of the vehicle for an extended period (a theft deterrent).
   8. Enrollment: The system wipes all old keys and enters learn mode. Insert the new keys one by one into the cupholder pocket and press the Start button to enroll them.
Locksmith Decision Logic:
When arriving at a job, the locksmith must decide between OBP and OBD methods.
   * Scenario: Customer has 2 working keys and wants a 3rd? -> Use OBP Add Key. It's fast, risk-free, and doesn't consume tool tokens.
   * Scenario: Customer has 1 working key? -> Use OBD Tool. The OBP "Add Key" is locked out (requires 2 masters). The OBP "All Keys Lost" takes 30 minutes, which is too slow. The OBD tool can bypass the wait.
   * Scenario: Customer has 0 keys? -> Use OBD Tool. Saves 30 minutes of idle time.
3.2 OBD Programming (The Professional Method)
For the professional locksmith, time is the primary currency. The 30-minute wait inherent in the OBP method is unacceptable for a service call. Professional diagnostic tools such as the Autel IM608, Smart Pro, and AutoProPad allow for the bypassing of these security timers by communicating directly with the BCM to authenticate the session.
Tool Compatibility and Selection:
   * Autel IM508 / IM608: These are industry standards for GM programming. The menu path is typically GM > Chevrolet > Blazer > 2019 > Smart Key. The tool guides the user through the process with on-screen prompts.
   * Smart Pro (ADS-2272): This platform is highly reliable for GM. It utilizes the "GM Prox 2017+" software. One of its key advantages is the ability to automatically read the PIN code from the BCM without manual entry or external calculation.
   * AutoProPad: A robust handheld option that also performs well on Global A vehicles.
The PIN Code Mechanism:
Unlike older Chrysler or Nissan systems where a PIN code must be calculated from the VIN using an external database or dealer portal, the 2019 Blazer's BCM allows the diagnostic tool to "Read PIN" directly via the OBD port. This is a function of the Global A architecture. When the "Read PIN" command is sent, the BCM challenges the tool. If the tool provides the correct manufacturer handshake, the BCM releases the 4-digit security code. This code is then used to authorize the "Add Key" or "All Keys Lost" command. On 2019 models, this process is typically instantaneous, whereas older GM models required a longer calculation time.
Step-by-Step OBD Procedure (Smart Pro Example):
   1. Connection: Plug the Smart Pro into the OBD-II port. Ensure the vehicle battery voltage is stable (above 12.5V). Connect a battery support unit if there is any doubt.
   2. Selection: Navigate to Chevrolet > Blazer > 2019 > Prox.
   3. PIN Extraction: Execute the "Read PIN" function. The tool will communicate with the BCM and display the 4-digit code. The software typically auto-populates this PIN for the next step.
   4. Erase/Program: Select the desired function. "Add Key" will append the new key to the existing list (preserving the customer's lost key if they find it later). "All Keys Lost" will erase the entire key table, ensuring that any missing keys can no longer start the vehicle.
   5. The Pocket Ritual:
   * The tool will prompt the user to place the key in the cupholder pocket.
   * Crucial Operational Detail: The antenna range in the cupholder is extremely short, often only a few millimeters. The locksmith must remove the rubber liner from the bottom of the cupholder. If the key sits on top of the rubber mat, it may be too far from the coil to receive the LF signal or transmit the UHF response reliably. The key should be placed flat against the plastic bottom, usually with the buttons facing up.
   6. Cycling: Follow the tool's prompt to press the Start/Stop button. The instrument cluster will flash, and the door locks may cycle to confirm success.
   7. Verification: Once the procedure is complete, exit the software. Test the remote functions (Lock, Unlock, Hatch, Panic) and, most importantly, the Proximity Start function. Ensure the vehicle starts without the key being in the pocket (i.e., just in the driver's lap) to verify the internal cabin antennas are detecting the key correctly.
4. Security Barriers: The "Shift to Park" Anomaly & Other Faults
Locksmiths frequently encounter 2019 Blazers that present symptoms mimicking a catastrophic immobilizer failure or a "bricked" BCM. In reality, these vehicles are often suffering from known mechanical defects inherent to the model year. Distinguishing between a "bad key/programming" and a "bad car" is vital to avoid liability and wasted time.
4.1 The "Shift to Park" (STP) Defect
This is the most pervasive and insidious issue affecting the 2019 Blazer. It is a mechanical failure with severe digital consequences.
   * The Symptom: The driver places the vehicle in Park and presses the Start/Stop button to turn the engine off. The engine stops, but the dashboard displays the message: ACTION REQUIRED: SHIFT TO PARK. The vehicle electronics remain in "Accessory" or "Run" mode, keeping the radio and cluster active. This rapidly drains the battery.
   * Locksmith Relevance: This is a critical barrier to programming. The BCM requires the vehicle to be in the "OFF" power mode and strictly in "PARK" to accept new key programming commands. If the vehicle believes it is still in Gear or Neutral, it will not allow the programming session to initiate. The tool may give a "Conditions Not Met" error.
   * The Root Cause: A microswitch inside the floor shifter assembly fails. The silicone contacts inside the switch wear out or become contaminated, preventing the switch from closing the circuit that signals "Park" to the BCM.
   * The Field Fix:
   * Temporary (For Programming): The locksmith can often force the contact by vigorously wiggling the shifter handle side-to-side or snapping the shifter button forward and backward while the lever is in the Park position. This mechanical agitation can momentarily engage the switch, clearing the message on the dash. Once the SHIFT TO PARK message disappears and the cluster goes dark (Off mode), programming can proceed immediately.
   * Permanent: The vehicle requires the installation of a new shifter harness or microswitch kit, as detailed in GM Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) 19-NA-206.
4.2 "No Remote Detected" & Pocket Location Physics
A common panic moment occurs when a brand-new, high-quality key is placed in the pocket, but the vehicle displays "No Remote Detected" and refuses to program.
   1. Dead Battery Check: Never assume a new key has a good battery. The first step in any failure is to test the CR2032 voltage. It must be above 3.0V.
   2. Interference: The 2019 Blazer's RCDLR is surprisingly sensitive to Radio Frequency (RF) interference. Cheap USB chargers plugged into the center console or dash power outlets can emit "noise" in the 433 MHz spectrum, blinding the receiver. Always unplug all accessories from the 12V and USB ports before programming.
   3. Pocket Specifics: As mentioned, the pocket is located at the bottom of the front cupholder. The LF antenna is a coil of wire located underneath the plastic console trim. The magnetic field it generates is weak. Dirt, coins, foil gum wrappers, or the rubber cup holder liner act as barriers. The key needs to be in the "sweet spot." If the standard "flat" orientation fails, try standing the key up on its side, or pointing the head of the key (where the emergency blade loop is) towards the front or rear of the vehicle.
4.3 Steering Column Lock (ESCL) Binding
While less common on the Blazer than on vehicles like the Nissan Altima or older Corvettes, the electric steering column lock can bind mechanically. If the driver parked with the wheels turned sharply against a curb, the steering column is under torque tension. The ESCL bolt is pinched and cannot retract when the Start button is pressed.
   * Symptom: The user presses Start. The relay clicks, but nothing happens. The DIC displays Service Steering Column Lock.
   * Fix: This is not a programming failure. The locksmith must instruct the user to relieve the tension on the steering wheel (turn it slightly left or right, fighting the resistance) while pressing the Start button. This allows the bolt to retract, freeing the system.
5. Mechanical Key Systems: The HU100 Interface
While the Blazer is a Push-to-Start vehicle, the mechanical emergency key blade remains a critical component. It is the only way to enter the vehicle if the 12V battery dies, and as detailed in the OBP section, it is the primary interface for triggering the "Add Key" procedure.
   * Keyway: HU100. This is the standard GM "High Security" or "Laser Cut" keyway used across the lineup since 2010.
   * Code Series: Z-Series (Z0001 - Z6000). This code series is distinct from the older "V" series used on bladed ignition vehicles.
   * Lishi Tool: The HU100 (V3) is the preferred pick and decoder for this lock.
   * Operational Note: The 2019 Blazer has no ignition cylinder. The locksmith must pick and decode the Driver's Door Lock.
   * Warning: Door locks are exposed to the elements. They are often filled with road grime, salt, and dried lubricant. GM door locks are notoriously stiff. Before inserting the Lishi tool, it is highly recommended to flush the lock with a solvent/lubricant (like Houdini or WD-40) and rake it with a standard key to loosen the wafers.
   * Reading: The HU100 lock typically has 8 cut positions. However, the door cylinder may not contain all 8 wafers. It might only have positions 3 through 10, or 2 through 9. The Lishi tool will allow you to read the depths (1 through 4) for the wafers present. The locksmith may need to "progress" or guess the missing cuts if the door lock is not fully populated, though on the Blazer, the door lock usually contains enough data to generate a working emergency key.
   * Cutting: The key must be cut on a high-security duplicator (e.g., SEC-E9, Triton, Condor). The Z-series cuts are axis-milled (laser cut) into the face of the blade, not the edge.
6. Inventory & Cross-Reference Strategy
For the locksmith business owner, inventory management is about maximizing coverage with minimum SKUs. The HYQ4EA remote is a "High Velocity" SKU because it covers a wide range of high-volume vehicles.
Master Cross-Reference List:
   * Chevrolet Blazer: 2019, 2020, 2021 (Global A models)
   * Chevrolet Traverse: 2018, 2019, 2020
   * Chevrolet Equinox: 2018, 2019, 2020 (Verify frequency - some Equinox models are split, but most high trims are 433 MHz)
   * Chevrolet Cruze: 2018, 2019 (Final production run of the Cruze)
   * Chevrolet Malibu: 2019, 2020 (Verify frequency)
Refurbishing and Reusability:
A critical question for profitability is the reusability of used keys. Used HYQ4EA keys are reusable, but they are not "plug and play." The PCF795x chip on the circuit board becomes "locked" to the VIN of the first vehicle it is programmed to.
   * The Lock: Once programmed, the configuration bytes in the chip's EEPROM are set to "Locked" status. The chip will no longer accept a "Write" command from a different BCM.
   * The Unlock: To reuse a key (e.g., a refurbished key from a vendor or a key taken from a wrecked vehicle), the locksmith must "Unlock" or "Flash" it. This requires a specialized tool like the Xhorse VVDI Key Tool Max, KeyDIY, or Autel XP400. These tools connect to the remote's PCB (often via pogo pins or by soldering wires) and reset the firmware to a "Virgin" or "Pre-Code" state. Once unlocked, the key is functionally identical to a new OEM key and can be programmed to a 2019 Blazer.
7. Comprehensive Troubleshooting Matrix


  



7.1 Detailed Fault Scenarios
Scenario A: The "Sleepy" BCM
   * Symptom: The programming tool communicates with the vehicle, reads the VIN, and calculates the PIN, but hangs indefinitely on "Configuring System" or "Learning Key."
   * Cause: Low battery voltage. The Blazer's modules are exceptionally power-hungry. If the system voltage drops below 12.2V, the BCM may refuse to write to the EEPROM to protect data integrity. This "Brownout Protection" is silent; it simply causes the process to fail.
   * Solution: Never attempt to program a modern GM vehicle without auxiliary power. Connect a high-quality battery maintainer or jump pack (capable of sustaining 13.5V at 20-30 Amps) to the battery terminals before beginning the session.
Scenario B: The "Ghost" Key
   * Symptom: The customer has lost all keys. You program two new keys. The dashboard message changes from "No Remote Detected" to "2 Keys Programmed." The customer asks, "What happened to the old keys?"
   * Context: By default, the "Add Key" procedure does not delete the old key identifiers from the BCM's registry. It merely appends the new ones. If the old keys were stolen, this is a security risk.
   * Procedure: If the customer is concerned about theft (e.g., a stolen purse), the locksmith must perform the "All Keys Lost" or "Erase Keys" function. This wipes the entire table and starts the count at 0. If the customer simply lost a key in the house, "Add Key" is sufficient and safer.
Scenario C: Remote Start Inoperative after Programming
   * Symptom: The new key successfully unlocks the doors and starts the engine. However, when the "Remote Start" button (arrow) is pressed, the parking lights flash, but the engine does not crank.
   * Cause: The 2019 Blazer has a strict set of inhibitors for Remote Start.
   1. Hood Latch: There is a safety switch integrated into the hood latch. If the hood is unlatched (or the switch is broken/corroded), remote start is disabled to prevent the engine from starting while a mechanic is working on it.
   2. Check Engine Light: Any active Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) related to the powertrain will disable remote start. This is to prevent damage to the engine.
   3. Valet Mode: Ensure the vehicle settings have not placed the car in Valet mode.
   * Fix: Use the diagnostic tool to scan for DTCs. Clear any codes. Check the hood latch continuity. Verify that the key fob actually has the remote start button (5-button) and that the vehicle trim supports it (some base 'L' models may not have the remote start receiver logic enabled, even if the key sends the signal).
Conclusion
The 2019 Chevrolet Blazer is a bread-and-butter vehicle for the modern automotive locksmith, sitting in the "Sweet Spot" of the market. It utilizes high-value, modern proximity keys that command professional pricing, yet it relies on the mature Global A architecture that remains accessible to standard tools without the need for expensive dealer credentials. Success on this platform is not a matter of luck; it is a matter of adherence to the physics of the 433 MHz signal, the inventory discipline of the HYQ4EA ecosystem, and the mechanical awareness of the Shift-to-Park defect. By mastering the nuances detailed in this report, the locksmith transforms a potential "problem car" into a reliable, high-margin service opportunity.

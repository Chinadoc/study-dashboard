again and we''re just going to hit
okay continue I
mean so the door closed which we didn''t
do
before and the ignition and on
and as you can see they''re giving us the
code so if you guys ever need to find a
code this is how you would do it uh very
nice and easy so you can also do that
while you already have the fdrs open
when you open up the
fdrs um also if you want to download
that and do everything is going to be uh
the easiest way is just go to Google and
search for
fdrs
login and then this is going to
be the website you want to go on to so
here it''s going to show you everything
and here it''s going to show you how much
it is and just create a new
customer uh open account or if you''re
existing just use existing customer um
but after you have done on that um
please make sure that you log in first
on here because when you''re going to go
here you''re going to choose
independent um and non dealer and then
you''re going to hit login this is when
after you downloaded the software and if
you log in here and it keeps giving you
an error over here and saying
unidentify so just if you scroll down
all the way
here
um it''s going to show you that you
should go to their website so basically
opening this website but not from the
fdrs just go and launch it on the on the
Google and do log in over there and then
it''s going to ask you if you''re locksm
or what are you um and this is the way
you can uh solve the problem if you''re
having issues to connect so just make
sure that you are using this option log
in and then doing that um and for the
downloading website we''re going to use
this uh website this is the the one that

Ford key and keep us stay tuned hello
I''m Derek and welcome to hindsight 101
well you learn about things that will
help you in everyday life I''m gonna show
you how to program your key and your key
fob yes there are two different things
even though they are connected this will
work for this type of key and also the
key that''s just a key and a separate key
fob this will work for all 2004 Ford
vehicles or later full disclosure I did
have some camera troubles and I had to
re-record so this key is already
programmed but I guarantee you this
works you can see I have two Ford keys
and then I also have this key here which
I got from eBay so what we''re going to
do is you need two keys in order for
this to work so if you don''t have two
keys you''re gonna have to go to the
dealership go to a locksmith or sir some
hardware stores do it as well so let''s
get started you want to take the key put
it in the ignition you''re going to hear
a chime then you have five seconds with
the other key in then you put the second
key in and then you have ten seconds to
put the key and you want to program
chime have five seconds put the key in
chime you got ten seconds you put in the
key you want to program now that key is
programmed but you''re going to notice
that the buttons don''t work so what
you''re going to have to do is put it in
program mode to get the buttons to work
I''m gonna show you how to do that now
you''re going to take one of your keys
and you have to turn it eight times in
the on position but you don''t have to
turn the car on and then this will put
it in program mode
you know you''re in program mode when you
hear the doors lock so now what you want
to do is hit the lock button on all the
keys that you have I forgot to mention
you want to make sure you have all the
keys that you need with you because it''s
going to reset all your key fobs so you
have to have all your keys with you and
you have to program them all not just
one so that''s why you had to press the
lock on all the keys take the key out
you hear the doors lock that means
you''re out of program mode so and then
one key to key and key three they all
work and then the key that I wanted to
program as you can see started the car
so I hope this helped if you liked what
you saw hit that like button you want to
see more hit subscribe take care', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

quickly um id our new key
make sure we''ve got the right chip in it
so we got a 4d63 chip and put the
original in here as well
make sure we''ve got the right one
and the same
so we''re going to do is let''s get the
ignition on let''s get the program
started we''ll swap over to the screen
and we''ll see what we can do right okay
so we''re uh
we''re all logged into this so we''ll just
have a look see what dtc''s we got we''ve
got none in any of the modules so we''re
happy with that
let''s go down and we''ll see if we can do
any patch programming
so we''ll click into it come down and
press play
is the vehicle equipped with a keyless
push start no it''s not
right so we just got a bit of a warning
here
saying about ignition key programming
difficulties extremes experienced a few
uh
a few bits and pieces here just giving
us a few warnings
so we''re gonna just carry on go yeah
okay so we want to do ignition key
programming so there''s already two keys
stored
and it says that at the top here as well
so we can erase
module initialization if you put a new
instrument cluster in it we can clear
the keys out which we don''t want to do
so we''re going to ignition key
programming click ok
ok so set the ignitions to
position 0 and insert the new key
so i''ll just turn it off there
grab the new key and we''ll put it in
so what i''m going to do it''s got the new
key
in with the ignition on and we''re going
to press ok
all right so it''s going to do the uh
access to the database with in codes
and it''s going to sort out the out code
for us as well
would you like to do it now yes
i don''t know how long this is going to
take as i say at the top here
it is saying it''s generating the codes
or two percent down there
we''ll just wait and see what it does
it says diag on the dash
okay so it''s all finished it says about
um
the key has not increased yet but we''ve
got to turn the ignition on and off and
then recheck the uh
the monitor see if we''ve got three so
come off
back on press okay
no we got two
okay so i tried the uh key procedure a
couple of times and it doesn''t seem to
be um giving me a higher key count
um it says everything''s successful but
probably what my thoughts are are
there''s probably more likely an issue
with the key that i''ve got
rather than the program itself so
what i''m gonna do in the interest of
keeping the video a bit shorter so i
don''t wanna
i''m trying not to make them over 10
minutes um what i''m going to do is i''m
going to order up a few different
transponders and i''m going to go through
and try a few different more
and see if we can get it working just to
make it a fair test
as i say i don''t think it''s the program
that''s a problem i think it''s more than
likely the key
so i''m going to do a few tests on that
and maybe convert it over to an 80-bit
chip from the 40-bit chip as well just
in case that''s a problem but i don''t
think it is on these earlier models
and we''ll go from there so all right
come along for the next video
it''ll be a part two to this and we''ll
see if we can get it working

built in on them um and the biggest
thing is to get them programmed and I''ll
show you how easy it is to do

one unlock on that one and be sure to do
both of them if you have two and uh and
that''s it now turn the key
off the the locks recycled
again off and on so
now there unlock lock

and here''s the second
one unlock and
lock so that is it so you don''t have to
go to a dealer to get it programmed you
can just do it right there at home just
cycle it eight times and wait for it to
to hear the locks go uh it''ll lock and
unlock them or vice versa I forget which
one but you you can hear it cycle and
then just go over there and push the
button on your key fob and uh then turn
the ignition off um and you''ll hear it
cycle again but that''s it it''s uh it''s

just uh don''t go to the dealership to do

channel today we have this 2012
dodge charger and we''re gonna program
new keys
for this car so this car uses
uh two different frequencies the 315
and the 420 35 i believe so
so as you can see these keys don''t work
but we have the original right here that
works
so i already pre-selected my car we''re
gonna select the dos charger
and we''re gonna read the pin number
first
this car and for that we have to close
the switch
[Music]
and put the house hazards on so
i''m gonna select automatic detection
and now we''re gonna wait by the way you
don''t need wi-fi for this
you can be connected with the car and
having that
and not having wi-fi so let''s just wait
and it should give me the the pin code
away
all right that''s the password 4601
and now we''re gonna go to contour
functions
and we''re gonna select immobilizer smart
system
and for this i believe we have to have
the keys outside of the car
not close to the ignition switch because
we''re gonna have interference so we''re
gonna remove the original key
out
and another of this key out too
and just to make sure it doesn''t detect
the keys we''re gonna press
this and it says keynote detected so
we''re good
and we''re gonna work with one key first
so let''s
select key learning
another key learning and it says turn
off
and turn the emergency flashers on
the flashers are on and we''re gonna
place the key to be learned
and it says only place one key
inside to be learned in the vehicle and
the other keys
are gonna be outside so there''s two keys
program
but we''re gonna learn another one so we
press ok
and it''s gonna ask for the pin number
which we already have
press ok all right and
as soon as it starts entering
it''s gonna ask you to unlock
press the unlock and unlock
at the same time so let''s do this until
we hear a peep
place this gear close to ignition
on the cup slot so we see here
we already programmed the key as you can
see
and it says if you want to learn another
key we press yes
and we take the other key that we had
we put the other one away
on the roof and then
it says remove the current key prepare
another kit we program
in the car slot so we press okay
and we''re gonna see the same
same screen we had so we press
the unlock press okay
and i heard the locks right away
so we have four keys already programmed
and now
we just press no because we already
finished
we exit this and now we turn off the
hazards
and let''s see if the key opens the
switch
as you can see and it opens the switch
let''s see if it turns on and it turns on
guys
so this is how you program the keys for
a 2012

show you how to use the simple key
programmer to make yourself a new key
fob and save tons of money over the car
dealership you can visit tomsky.com
where you can order this for yourself
let''s go take a look at how it''s done so
here''s the new one we''re going to
program
we''ll put it in
see it does nothing to start the
engine i get a warning light up here on
the dash says wrong key fob
i push the buttons nothing happens
let''s program it the simple key user
guide this instruction manual i''ll show
you each of the steps that you need to
know
the first thing we''ve got to do is
activate our the fob that comes with
your simple key programmer it''s pretty
easy press
the lock and panic button we''re going to
watch for a little light to turn on
sometimes it can be under here in this
case there''s a little blue light that''s
going to show up right under here
i don''t know if you can see that but
there''s a
little blue light that''s turned on in
there
so that lets you know it''s ready to be
activated
now in order to activate it
you need to enter the activation code
so from your instruction manual find
your vehicle in my case this is 2017
dodge ram
the code''s 314.
so
to enter the code we''re going to
use the lock button so that''s the first
digit and the second digit is the panic
button the third digit is the unlock
button
so i''ve got to turn this back on the
light''s turned off
so press and hold
blue light''s on so i''m going to enter
three
by clicking lock
one
two
three times
then i''m going to press the panic button
once for the number one
and then my code was three one four so i
need to press unlock four times
four
now i''m going to press the lock and
panic buttons together
and the light will blink back the 314
code
three pause and then one blink pause one
two three four blinks
okay so it got the correct code
all right this has been activated and is
now ready to be programmed the key that
comes in the box will require activation
but many of the additional keys and key
fobs that we sell do not require
activation prior to programming you''ll
know this because no activation light
will turn on
this is where we take our simple key

again with the instruction manual we
come over here find we need to turn to

I like
when you come to the vehicle we''re just

we''re just gonna go manual in this case
to make it easier
so we''re going to treat it like an okay
last so let''s say we don''t have a key so
we''re not going to put the key in the

so every time we''re connecting with the
star or bypass it takes a little bit
longer
um to load this screen by the way if you
guys want to do it with the 12 8 you''re
just gonna need to take this entire
thing out put your fingers really really
low over there and disconnect the 12 8.
the star is way easier using an
extension cord for the OBD

control unit
and we''re gonna go really mobilize our

um that thing will take like about three
minutes sometimes sometimes it''s faster
my other tool can put uh can pull the
password faster than this but
you''re just gonna wait make sure your
Internet is good
um in order to do that and
we will see when it''s uh having the
password ready for us
so as you can see
uh we got the password
you could take a picture for that for
your own reference
and then we''re gonna go to keyless

I''m gonna press OK having the key on our

it just wants us to hold it next to the

area
and then you''re gonna need to press and
release
the unlock
and the job is done
we just press the unlock near that area
it''s going to say current number of keys
three
and as you can see that key is already

Hey, I''m Will and with Noble Locksmith
and you''re watching my YouTube channel,
Car Key Wizard. I''m an automotive
locksmith and while I definitely don''t
know it all, I have learned some tricks
along the way that I hope will help you
while you''re out in the field. One thing
you can do to help me out though would
be to subscribe to my channel. And if
you like my videos, leave a comment or
ask a question and I''ll get back to you
as soon as I can. I make a lot of
videos, so if there''s something you''d
like to learn more about or a video
you''d like to see on a car we''re working
on, just let me know in the comments and
I''ll put it up as soon as I can. Thanks,
and I hope you enjoy watching our
videos.
&gt;&gt; All right, we have another Pacifica
uh we''re going to be doing with the IM
608. Um, just a pro tip for you. Try to
remember that with these uh accessible
vans, when you open the sliding door
with the remote, with the double click
for the sliding door, the ramp comes out
and cracks you in your shin if you''re
not expecting it.
Learned that lesson three times. Maybe
maybe next time I''ll remember it and
then I crack my shin.
I''m going to remember someday. Today was
not that day. Let''s see here.
We''ll auto select this one. Chrysler.
So, a customer has two working keys,
one good, one bad. They both work except
for this key. The proximity function
doesn''t work. The remote works. It will
start when you hit the start button with
the key, but the prox function doesn''t
work for some reason. Um, I''m going to
add just add another key so she''s got
it.
Um, I''m on the starport, which is in the
SE-pillar back here, and I had to rig
up. Pretty proud of myself for this one.
I had a very long extension. I can''t
find it, but I found two other OBD
extensions. So, I''ve got one going into
the OBD into another extension
into the splitter, which then has the
star port on the other side.
the I was going to do it with the Smart
Pro because the Smart Pro you don''t need
to actually be on the OBD for power. It
goes all through the Starport, but our
uh
Smart Pro we use tokens on. And I
figured
I''m pretty smart. I can figure out how
to make this work. And I did.
So, we did the auto select, pulled up
the VIN,
Let''s
turn off. Don''t kill the battery. One
thing I always do when I get in a car,
especially on a Chevy or Ford where
you''re going to be doing a 10 to 12
minute wait, turn the AC off. Depending
if the car is going to have the ignition
on for a long time, I just do it
automatically when I get in. Turn the AC
off so you don''t run the battery down.
All right, we''re going to go control
unit. Read the password
off. Hazards on.
Done.
I do not have interwebs. That''s
interesting.
Weird. Uh, I will be back in a second
here. I don''t know why I wouldn''t have
internet.
Okay, so we''re back with internet.
Second time I''ve done that this week.
The Starlink, while it is an amazing
thing, does work better plugged in. I''m
adding a second monitor in the back of
my van for EPROM work and shuffling
stuff around there. I keep unplugging
the damn Starlink. So, we''re
communicating 1 to 10 minutes for the
password. Shouldn''t take too long, but
we will be back when that comes back.
All right, we have password 83462.
and go back to keyless system
key learning.
See number of keys. I would expect it to
be two. Four. Wow. I don''t know what the
limit is on these.
See if email information tells me
does not. Well, we''ll try to add one.
We''re going to find out.
I think these are six, but honestly, I
just don''t know.
Key learning. Key learning.
Please make sure the ignition is off.
Ignition is off.
83462. I''m glad that autopop populated
because I definitely forgot.
Hold the key near the start stop button
and complete procedure within 60
seconds.
Determine the key type.
Oh, this is a key sense casing.
This is my favorite part.
Current number of keys is five. Learning
successful. Do you want to learn the
next key? No, I do not. We are done. So,
I did not get a lock cycle that I heard.
Anyway,
but yeah, it did take that key. Here''s
my key. Took the key. Um, this is a key
sense key. That''s why it asked that last
part there. So, I did hit no because it
was a key sense key,
but we''re good to go. My extensions
worked. And again, that ramp comes out.
Just saying it again, so maybe I''ll
remember.', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

                             VALUES ('kYwGd2H7S0I', 'all right guys so that was a little bit
more involved than I was hoping for
programmed it now we''ve got two
keys hey guys welcome back to the
channel hope you''re having a fantastic
day in today''s video we''re back working
on some mods on my son''s 2018 Ram
Tradesman if you''ve been following along
we''ve been doing quite a bit of stuff to
the truck I''ll leave the links down
below to the playlist and everything if
you want to see where it started off
until where it is today uh but in
today''s video
this truck when we purchased it only
came with one key and I absolutely hate
that when the dealers do that we got it
from a Ford dealership so of course
they''re not going to go above and beyond
to worry about trying to get a second
key for it uh we had that happen with
another vehicle we purchased in the past
and it''s always kind of a nightmare to
pay the expensive prices of the the
original OEM keys from Dodge or any
dealership and then the programming
costs that come along with it so uh if
you hadn''t noticed by the thumbnail or
the title we''re going to try to use use
some OBD2 connectors Bluetooth to a jcan
app on our iPad to see if we can''t
program another key for this vehicle so
we''ve done some research we''ve got all
the parts I''ll show you what we got on
the bench over here I''ll leave all the
links to everything that we purchased
down below so if this goes well and you
want to do this yourself you''ll have
links to to uh where we got it just
bought most of this stuff off of Amazon
we got the new key from keyless Joe keys
I think if you Google that again I''ll
leave the link down below uh and
everything else everything was pretty
pretty cheap you can find these OEM
Dodge Keys online for like $90 plus uh
with keyless Joe I think I got it for 49
bucks so you can save a lot of money if
if this goes well of course and so uh to
to buy that and it it''s exactly the same
again I''ll show you here in just a
second but that''s what we''re got to do
today um in doing so though uh we did a
test run and I found out that you have
to uh for the software and the connector
and stuff if you want to change other
settings on the vehicle you can do so
but you have to have a security bypass
cable to do that I''ll show you that more
in depth too but the main point of this
video is to try to get that um extra key
uh program so if we get into emergency
or the other one fails or we got a
problem we got a backup so that''s what
we''re going to do today if you want to
follow along please hit subscribe I''d
appreciate it hugely uh click like if
you found it helpful or informative and
and if you got any questions or comments
leave them down below I try to answer
everything for everybody but let''s show
you what we got on the bench and what
we''re going to do so here''s what we''ve
got on the V bench uh we''ve got the
vgate iar pro Bluetooth adapter so it
plugs right into your OBD2 port
underneath the dash on most all vehicles
and you can check them out again that
link will be down in the description box
but we''ve we''ve already tested this out
they''ve got and it''s it''s working
flawlessly here''s our Brand New Key
again exactly like like Factory it even
has the embossed Ram logo exactly like
Factory comes with a battery and
everything ready to go uh you can hear
it''s not doing anything to the truck
it''s not programmed so hopefully we''ll
resolve that shortly uh with this it
comes with a with an appbook with all
kinds of software that you can use
there''s number one is the
jcan that we''re using on the iPad over
here uh but there''s all kinds of stuff
in here there''s uh Torque Pro and all
kinds of other Pro programs Alpha OBD is
another one I think a lot of people I
have researched and seen people like
that one a lot but we we went with the
jcan program and so once you have it
plugged in your car you can pick from
all kinds of different vehicles and of
course we''re in the ram category and
then you''ve got all kinds of different
1500s 2500s year models and makes and
everything so this will work for quite a
few different vehicles and then while we
were playing around with the settings
for a a test run trial run we found out
if you want to change stuff like you
know uh door code not codes uh Chimes
and parking lights and daytime running
lights and tire sizes and all that you
can do that with this but you need what
is called a security bypass cable and so
this will allow you to plug that adapter
here into there and bypass your security
so not going to spend a lot of time on
that I''m going to make another video
about that if you want to check in in or
subscribe and we''ll we''ll pick up with
that in another video but we did get
that I''ll go ahead and leave the link
but in this video we''re just going to
worry about this key so let''s get it all
in the truck and see what we got guys I
wanted to jump in really quick in the
video and tell you I would suggest
trying to program your key without that
security bypass cable from the start
your making model might be different
than ours and we were doing more stuff
in the video like I was saying
programming tire sizes daytime running
lights and other stuff so that''s why
you''ll see in the video we remove the
dash to get to the security box and use
the cable so we just did it all at one
time but you may be able to save even
more money not have to buy the cable and
I would definitely try that first before
you ripped everything apart if all
you''re wanting to do is try to program a
new key but anyway let''s jump back to it
here''s a look at the app while we''re in
it so you once you''re connected to it
Bluetooth you''ve got your dash dashboard
modules and adaptation so under
adaptation if I can do all this and hold
it you can see so we''re under the radio
uh Hub settings and then we''ve got to go
to ignition key if I get my stupid hand
out of the way ignition key programming
transponder programming mode beta so
it''s still in a in progress but so we
need the transponder mode not the one
for push to start um pass keyless entry
and and starting uh not for this vehicle
anyway so here we are we''re going to
click on that before we do that we''ve
got to get our pin
reading it says unknown all right guys
so that was a little bit more involved
than I was hoping for so we could not
seem to get the uh Alpha OBD app we
downloaded that and tried it we tried
the jcan app couldn''t get that one to
read the pin number from the module
either jumped online to the ram Forum
real quick did some research found out
that people downloaded another app
called the Chrysler pin poer app and
I''ll leave a link down to that below as
well um the app itself is free of course
to pull the pin from the module like we
needed it you have to buy credits or
tickets you get 15 free tickets and
there''s a few things you can do for free
but of course we needed uh 50 tickets in
order to do it so it cost us $14.99 to
buy the tickets I was a little hesitant
but I said well short of taking it to
the dealership like most other people
did so some people had luck with that
did it for free some people uh got
charged for it downloaded it it only was
available for Android that I saw so I
did not see it for my iPad or uh Apple
PL uh Apple Store and so I was able to
download it on my phone which is why I
didn''t video it and it pulled it
immediately got the PIN number so now
we''re swapping back over to the iPad
going to punch it in see if we can
program this key finally all right so
now that we''re back on the iPad uh we
we''ve got our pin number we''re going to
try this again and see see how it goes
so we''re back to ignition key
programming
transponder uh it says warning may be
unsupported that''s okay no big deal
we''re going to hit that we''re going to
hit
go and it''s going to say to program
additional key fobs we''re going to say
go and ignition must be in the lock off
position while running this function so
we''re good there we''re going to hit go
please wait enter your vehicle PIN
number so this is where we read it out
from the other one it''ll be unique for
everybody so we''re going to tap in there
and we''re going to hit
go
waiting please ensure unprogrammed I
didn''t even read that wait two seconds
all right guys so that was just my fault
uh the the software was so fast I
thought it was going to prompt us to to
put the new key or the unprogrammed key
into the ignition but it assumes you
already have it in the ignition so
before you hit start uh it says to have
it in the off lock position go ahead and
put the new unprogrammed key in there
then hit go it reads it and it did it
almost instantly probably less than two
seconds and it said it was completed and
I said there was no way in the world it
did it that fast and we tested the
buttons and cranked the truck it worked
fine so little bit more more in- depth
than what we were hoping having to go
get the Chrysler pin puller app to get
the number off of it you may not run
into that trouble depending on your year
model make or whatnot but it wouldn''t
pull it on ours for some reason on this
2018 so maybe it''s just the way they''ve
upgraded them or changed something but
anyway uh pin puller app worked perfect
got it off of there plug the number in
hit the button programmed it now we''ve
got two keys it ask you if you want to
continue to program more keys you can if
you want to we only had the one extra
but now we have two so that was a
success we''re good to go all right guys
another successful project completed few
extra steps than we originally thought
which that''s the way every single
project ever goes around here but that''s
that''s just the norm but successful
that''s the key word so we got in this
video it kind of maybe jumped around a
little bit because I was filming a
couple couple of different things in
here that we were trying to accomplish
the biggest thing the whole point of the
video was to program a spare key worked
flawlessly now we did have to get the
pin puller app I''ll leave all the links
down below to all of this stuff that we
purchased off of Amazon um the key that
we purchased the bypass cable Bluetooth
connector and uh and the apps that we
had to use for this too so uh we did
have to pay for a license for the jcan
app so you can do a couple of free
things in there but to use some of the
more advanced features you do have to
purchase a license I think it was $20
for a license it''s locked to the VIN
number of the vehicle so you can store
multiple licenses and your garage in the
app which is pretty cool uh but you do
have to do that to do some of the more
advanced features in programming on the
truck so not a big deal still turned out
cheaper than it would have to have to
buy a key from the dealership get them
to program it all that stuff so we''re
still ahead in that regard and it''s kind
of fun to just work on the truck and do
some more mods and and uh customizations
to it so all in all worked out great
hope you enjoyed the video I gave you
some tips and tricks or figured out
where this thing was or how to get

video today we''re going to do a aty or
UL lost for uh Dodge
R the year for this car is going to be
uh
2023 um and the connection that we''re
going to
use will be just under the seat under
the let me just try to give you a good
look of it
[Applause]
so these will be the two
connectors that you''re going to need to
remove and uh then connect to the 128 so
we''re just going to connect that we''re
going to be with that or you can use the
star which is right here but both of
them are very
excessive um and they are right under
here so those will be the connections
that you''re going to do on the Ram uh
trucks so we''re just going to connect it
and be right with you so we took those
two connectors we plugged them into the
connectors and then into the OBD of the
scanner and then we can start with the
tool and again all kyos add the key will
be the
same uh we just going to put the hazard
lights to wake up the
car so when we go to dodge we''re going
to get to here um I would like to go to
manual selection just because the tool
sometimes will throw you to the wrong
spot and then we''re going to go North
America and by the models we''re going to
go to the
ram
DT so we''re going to go to the ram
DT and it tells us to put the key if we
have a key but we didn''t put anything
on and only have uh the key that we''re
going to learn to the
car when we get to here we''re just going
to go control
unit and we''re going to go uh redem
mobilizer
password and we''re going to hit
okay and that thing will take a while
usually and of course make sure you
connected to the
Internet so I will just be with you guys
as soon as uh I get the
password so after a good 5 minutes or so
we got the PIN code right here so we''re
just going to take a picture of that so
we have it in our system and then we''re
going to hit
okay and now we can go escape we can go
control unit and we''re going to go to
the
killas here we''re going to go key
learning and then key learning again
again you want to have only one key uh
in the car um all the other Keys should
be far enough so it doesn''t
interfere um and now we''re just going to
press okay and then we''re going to press
yes having this key he put already the
password for us we''re just going to hit
okay
okay and then we''re going to need to put
the key on the push
button and we''re going to press with
that so we''re just going to leave it
like that
so we don''t release until they going to
tell us to do
so so sometimes it''s not going to catch
it in the first uh step um so what I
like to do when it tells us to press
with the corner of the key I just going
to press with my finger and then I''m
going to bring the key close to it so
we''re going to try
again and now we''re going to press with
our finger and then we''re going to bring
the key close to
it and it worked so basically I pushed
with my finger and I put that close
um so it tells us that we can release it
now and now we''re going to add another
one so we''re just going to take this key
far away and we''re going to put the new
one so now having another key but it''s
not programmed we''re just going to do
that again so again in this case my
trick is you''re going to press with one
key uh with one finger and then you''re
going to bring the other finger onto it
so I''m pressing with the finger and then
I''m bringing the key close
I can also press the
unlock but again sometimes it''s going to
take a
little a little
more so again this time I took the
finger off so this why it got stuck so
we just going to wait for that cycle to
go and we''re going to do again
and now we''re going to say yes it''s a
little bit harder when I have uh holding
the camera for you
guys but I would do it with two hands
usually so I''m taking one hand and then
I''m putting the key right by
it and I hear that going so now it''s
going to take tell us to
release and this is how you''re going to
do those uh RAM so again I pressed with
one finger and then I brought it close
if you have two hands one hand going to
press it and then the other hand will
just reach it close and you can also
press the unlock in the meantime to get
it uh up and going um so this is how you
can do it and now we have the other key
out we''re just going to start the
car and as we can see the car start
right
away um one more thing uh tip um if you
ever wonder what key do you need to use
so any car that will be the 1500 will
use the FCC that starts with the ohd and
the one that that''s 2500 and up will use
the gq4 so just keep that in mind um in
what key you want to generate or use the
buttons configuration does not matter
all of them are the same there is two uh
kind of frequency thank you guys for
watching I will see you on the next car
so again one more time the connection uh
for the Dodge Ram um
2020 3 um will be right under here um
and the box is that
box that''s missing those two cables
right here in the middle and if you want
you can also use the
star which is the yellow
one on top of it there

going on maybe I got it in the wrong
spot well we''ll go through and we''ll
just double check everything says it''s
ready for remote 3 so it''s configuring
the
system it didn''t work but we''re going to
check
it so it''s going through the current key
is complete matching you want to match
the next one no because we''re done
matching Keys switch the ignition
off okay switched it off press the stop
start run for 12 seconds
this does the counting for
us I didn''t think it took that key I
know it
didn''t so we''re going to find out
though so release the stop start button
hit
okay configuring the system please wait
Seconds long press the stop start button
till the ignition turns on so we''re
going to long press it and wait for the
dash to come on so not that light but
the big ones them ones so them lights
come
on so we''re just paying attention to
what it''s telling us to
do switch the ignition
off so it''s off press and hold the brake
and the stop start button and wait and
wait for the engine well the problem is
I have this other key in here so I''m
going to take this key
out and we''re going to go just like this
and we''re going to press and hold the
brake so it says no remote detected so I
know it didn''t
work I knew it didn''t work so this is a
good problem to have so we''ll let it go
through it what it
says we''re going to try this again
so we have to go through and it didn''t
program so we have to go through it and
we have to figure out why it didn''t
program there could be many reasons why
it could be a bad key it could have been
St sit in the wrong
spot but I looked in the owner''s manual
and that''s exactly where the owner''s
manual tells you to put the new
key so we''re just waiting for it right
now to uh to get back out of this mode
so once it gets out of this mode I''ll be
back all right now it says it
failed I''ll take a look it''s good to
fail I mean it''s not good to fail really
but we''re going to start over and do
this again so we''re going to hit
start yes we want to we want to start
the key learning process yes
press the stop star button
once
okay okay it''s in the slot where it says
it''s supposed to go oh there''s the PIN
code all right switch the ignition
off I believe it is off just checking
the network it''s waiting 5
Seconds to configure the
system configuring the system could take
12 minutes so we got to go through this
again so we''re going to try it again we
don''t usually fail but we did this time
so this is a good lesson I guess got to
try
again all right we''re back now and
here''s a couple of things that I''ve done
if you
look I''ve got the fourways on I don''t
normally put the fourways on and I''ve
also moved the key from this Center here
to the cup holder and it says ready for
remote
three right
there so it says to push the start start
button stop start button
once didn''t
work so we''re going to try to find where
this is at
all right I don''t see any other place in
this vehicle or we could program a a
key
but let''s
see ready for remote
I''ll try that
one all
right I''m going to pause it it''s ready
for
remote all right hang on one
second all right so
no problems that we can''t resolve so I''m
going to turn it back and show you so so
we''re still on remote
3 from what I understand about this
vehicle now
is the programming
slot is underneath of this which you
lift up this is the
console I don''t know how to close it but
under here''s this another
console and in that counil in the corner
is a pocket and this is where you put
your key if the battery goes dead and to
program the button so now we''re going to
go back up here and we''re going to push
the stop start button one
time and it changes to remote 4 and I
hit okay here found it and I hit okay on
here and we go through this configuring
the system
okay so we''re configuring the system
we''re going to wait 10
seconds 9 10 and then we''re going to the
current complete key is complete and
matching do you want to match the next
key no just need switch the ignition off
one button should push it off so it''s
off press the stop start button for 12
seconds so we''re it''ll count for us so
we''re pressing in the button it''s
counting for
us we''re still on remote four see the
remote four down
there release the stop start

wait for the back dash lights to come on
all of them right there
okay release

it succeeded
all right so in the owner''s manual it
said the pocket was
here
which wasn''t here so it said it was
here I don''t even know how to pull this
up oh right here maybe this is it right
so it said it
was it was right
here or it said it would be here however
Maybe in the
book it should have
said you have to lift

                             VALUES ('2sn5_Ht7nfk', 'How''s it going, guys? Today, I''m going
to be programming second key for my 2016
Chevy Tahoe PPV. When I got this car
from the auction, it only came with one
key, which is typically how it goes. In
situations like this, you should always
make yourself a spare key as soon as
possible. Otherwise, if you lose your
one and only key, it''s going to cost you
a lot more to get the new key from a
dealer. But, if you have at least one
working key, the process is going to be
much easier. I got my key online from
this website tommskey.com. The price of
the key was $35 and for additional $60,
they offer key cutting service by photo.
You simply send them a couple pictures
of your existing key and they will cut
same exact copy and ship it to you.
They also sell remotes, keys, and
programming devices for many other car
makes and models. And if you ever have a
need for a spare key, check them out.
You might be able to find what you need.
When I got the keys, I made sure that it
works in the door lock and in the
ignition cylinder, and it worked
flawlessly. They got it right the first
time. Now, I''m going to need to program
this key. And I''m going to try to do it
live on the video so you could see how
this process works. If I turn the key, I
get service theft deterrent system
warning on the dashboard. And if I try
to crank the engine, it doesn''t work.
and instead this immobilizer light comes
on and stays on the dashboard.
I also got some key rings from them for
my key and this really cool magnetic key
storage box.
You can use it to hide your second key
somewhere underneath your car and in
case of emergency you can just take it
out, get your spare key, start your car
and drive off. You can also keep your
house key in there. And if you ever lock
yourself out, you will be able to get
back in.
So, let''s go ahead and program this new
key.
And just to confirm that it''s not
programmed yet, if I try to start the
car, it doesn''t work. Let''s set it aside
for now.
Now, I''m going to use my original good
working key and start the car.
Next, we''re going to need to turn off
the car and within 5 seconds, insert the
new key and turn it into the on
position. We''re going to give it a few
seconds to allow it to program the new
key. I think you''re supposed to get a
confirmation on the screen that the new
key is programmed, but since I have
other warnings displaying on the screen
currently, I didn''t really see that
confirmation message, but if you notice
that immobilizer light is gone, so I
think we should be good now. Let''s go
ahead and try to start the car.
And bam, it worked. As you can see, it''s
pretty simple and easy process to
program new keys on these Chevys. And
for me, the best part is I didn''t even
have to leave my couch. I took a few
pictures, ordered the key online. It
showed up in few days and I was done.
Didn''t have to drive to a dealer or
local locksmith, which is really, really
nice. And to make sure it was not a
fluke, let''s try to start it again. Here
we go. It works great. We are all set
now. All right. I hope this was helpful.
And if you guys interested in the next
video, I can also show you how to
program remote for your Chevy. Stay
tuned for that. And don''t forget to hit
that like button. I put a lot of effort
to make this video easy, simple, and
straight to the point. Thanks. Have a
nice day. Bye.', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

on 2010 through 2021 4Runners and lots
of other vehicles so be sure to visit
tomsk key.com and see if we can''t help
you get another car ke remote for a
whole lot less than it costed the
dealership got had a friend reason they
call it dealership and they want to
charge aote or $400 for a new key in
remote it was ridiculous instead of that
you can go to tomy.com place in order
and will rent you this car key
programming device uh we also Char the
deposit be sure it get sent back after
you programed your key we''re also
sending new key that you need and
everything to make it quick and easy and
even include the free return mailing
label your back now if your vehicle has
a push button start that uses a keyless
smart fob like this don''t worry we''ve
got you covered with that as well all
right the first thing we need to do is
get this cable plugged into the OBD2
port look up you''re going to find a plug
like this almost always it''s white on
some Vehicles it may be up in this area
usually it''s under by the brake pedal
simply plug it
in and we''re ready so let''s take a look
at our uh can remote here''s the working
one you notice the remotes are working
just
great and here''s the new
one doesn''t work at all we''re going to
set this up here
here to
program you''re going to take Tom''s car
key programmer this is model
tsl2 and when you plug it
in be sure you screw it in on this side
you''re going to find some
lights notice the Bluetooth light is lit
up as red we need to get that blue by
connecting to the
phone with the programmer rental we
include a phone that is already to make
your programming process easy the
programmer will show a red light at
first fire up the app and the programmer
light turns blue when the device and
phone have paired all right you see it''s
turned blue so we''re connected this is
good so once it''s paired once it''s
activated then we''re going to go into
immobilization
here don''t need to download and set up
some information we''re going to do the
remote first
remote now at this point you got to take
your working key put it into the
ignition turn it two clicks to the on
position one
two you can see some lights on the
dashboard up here now we need to connect
so sometimes you can tell which which
you need but the easiest way if you
can''t aren''t sure just start at type one
you''ll hear a very faint click it''s
going to try to connect and it''ll fail
if it''s not the correct one for your
vehicle so that failed to connect try
type two now it clicks and it''s popped
open has the ability to erase remotes
and program remotes you can erase
remotes if you''d like that''ll erase any
remotes that out in the world for your
vehicle so if you bought it used things
like that you could do it when you erase
the remote it''ll follow a very similar
step it''s programming remote we''re just
going to go right into program here
tells us to switch the vehicle to on
position so I''m going to turn it off and
then two clicks to the on position again
just to reset things and open the
driver''s
door so I''ve opened the driver''s door
now once I do that hit yes then you get
the key I need to
program it''s trying to
communicate says to press the lock and
unlock button for one second and then
press the lock button so take this
listen for a beep
you may need to repeat this a few
times right hear that
beep it''s
programmed programming success
occasionally it''ll say success even if
it was not successful give it another
try so let''s make sure this works just
pulled this out watch the lock here
locked
unlock
lock the
alarm Okay my working one worked as well
so that''s how you program the new
remote okay when you go to program a new
key the first thing to check is whether
you have a master key or valet
key now valet key from Toyota often has
a gray head but not all the time way you
can tell find your blinking red light in
this 4Runner it''s right over here it can
be Elsewhere on the dashboard it can be
up near the the speedometer sometimes
it''s over on the far side of the
steering wheel or up on the very top but
in this case it''s right over here when
we take our master key and slide it in
the ignition watch the blinking red
light it turned off immediately and sto
blinking pull it out the blinking starts
again this is a valet
key now watch the blinking red light
when this goes in it''ll turn on stay on
for a couple seconds see how it''s on
then it turned off that lets you know
you have valet key if you have valet key
you cannot program a new car key and
it''s important to note that on a key
like this with a remote there''s two
things to program both the buttons are
one and then the chip that lets the
engine start is the other so be sure you
have a master key so to program our new
key you''ve seen that this is the master
key watch the blinking red light when
this new one goes in notice we haven''t
cut this yet slide it in the light''s
still
blinking the chip isn''t programmed so
this key even if it''s cut isn''t going to
start the
vehicle but program it take your master
key plug it in turn it two clicks to the
on
position now come back to your app
remember we''re still still have the blue
um light showing it''s on blue tooth
connection you need to move back till
you get to this
page if you go all the way back to home
screen
immobilization and then
immobilizer once we''re in
immobilizer now there''s several
different choices usually you can tell
if you have a d chip or a g chip or an H
chip in this case this key is a g chip
the Toyota master has the letter G
stamped right there on the metal
blade not if it''s an aftermarket key it
doesn''t always have that stamp on it all
right we''re going to select type Three G
chip 2011 through
2015 this actually works on 2010 through
2021 4 Runners we''re working to add more
there''s a few different options you want
to stay away from the engine reset
things like that that''ll cause you
problems you can erase some lost keys if
you''ve got lost keys out there it''ll
walk you right through it it''s quite
simple it''s very similar similar to what
we''re going to do today and that''s
adding a new key if you have too many
keys out there you''ll need to erase lost
keys because you can only program four
or five keys on most
Toyotas okay we''re going to click add a
key tells us we need a master key we
already confirmed we''ve got a master key
hit yes all right it says insert the
program master key switch to the on
position that''s two clicks one two hit
yes to continue now I want you to watch
where the blinking red light is when we
hit yes it''s going to turn on
solid okay see how it''s solid that means
it''s ready to insert the key that we
need to
program here''s our key to be programmed
so we''re going to pull out the working
key going to put this in and watch that
red light starts
blinking now it''s going to take 60
seconds in order
program so notice the blinking pattern
it''s blinking at about one blink every 1
second and that''ll continue the whole 60
seconds if you look at it Clos and it''s
blinking differently like it might have
a couple fast blinks a pause three fast
blinks pause that''s a sign of something
else that is a problem with programming
process so we can help you through help
at tomsk key.com there''s also frequently
asked questions on the website that can
help solve common issues now we''re
approaching 60 seconds so watch that
blinking red light it''ll stop blinking
when the programming is done there we go
it''s
finished now we can take out our
key on our app wait for the security
light turn off program is complete hit
okay
and we''re done it was that easy so how
do you check that this is programmed
remember a blinking red light slide it
in and it turns
off pull it out the light''s blinking
before you can use your new spare key

notified whenever I upload new videos on
how to do DIY car repairs and projects

stuff.
For this project, we''re going to need a
Windows-based computer and a special
cable to connect the computer to the
OBD2 port on your car. You can buy this
cable at the link I provided below this
video.
After you install the drivers and
software for the cable, plug it into the
OBD port on your car and into the USB
port on your computer.
Next, remove your foot from the brake
pedal and press the start button twice
without starting the engine. Next,
launch the software that came with the
cable and then connect to your vehicle.
Next, select your car, make, model,
year, engine code, and the smart key
option.
Next, go to smart key menu. Click on
utility button and then click on smart
code registration.
On the next page, you''ll need to confirm
that you met all of the requirements
before you can start programming
procedure.
On the next page, you can see the number
of spaces available for new key codes.
As you can see, in my case, there are
only two key codes registered to my
vehicle. So, I have three more spaces
available. If you don''t have any spaces
available, just go back to the smart key
menu and erase some of the codes of the
keys that you lost or you don''t have
anymore. Before you start, make sure to
put the new key that you''re trying to
register at least one foot away from the
vehicle and put your existing registered
key inside the vehicle.
Next, you''ll need to click on pre-start
check button to review the registration
process.
Read about all of the steps for
programming procedure and then close the
window.
Now you can start the registration
process. Keep in mind that each of the
following steps has to be completed
within 30 seconds or less.
Touch the engine start button with your
registered smart key. You should hear
one beep. Remove the registered key from
the car and then place the new key into
the vehicle.

remote and then you''re going to rent
tom''s car key programmer this little box
i''ll send everything in the mail to you
that you need to take care of this
program it''s really easy to do let''s
take a closer look now the first thing
with the package will come this little
extension cable you find a little plug
that looks like this
occasionally it might have a cover over
the end
take the extension cable
that''ll make it easier to plug in tom''s
car key programmer with the extension
cable plugged in we''re ready to do this
you got to look around and find where
your blinking red security light is
in this camera it''s here on the dash
sometimes up near speedometer sometimes
it''s elsewhere with your new remote and
new key that i''ll send you through tom''s
key company
it''s not going to work at first so your
security light
you put it in security light keeps
blinking
that means there''s not a valid key
if we put our working key in
see the light turns off a valid working
key
lights blinking
this key doesn''t work let''s look at the
remote
here''s the working remote
unlocks the car
locks the car
makes the alarm
everything''s good
if i take my
one that doesn''t work
nothing works
i''m going to take your working key on
these camrys it''s really important to
take a look at the blade of the key
right here on factory ridge factory
original keys you''ll see a letter in
this case it''s a g
sometimes it can be an h sometimes it
can be a little dot
some years it changes from one symbol to
another
so you got to be sure you''re using the
right symbol that''s the chip in your
vehicle you''re going to take your
working key

there it started beeping
watch the light
okay that means it''s ready to program
the new key take out the working key
put in the new one see this is uncut
now it starts blinking
will now blink for 60 seconds
it''s important to watch the blinking
speed it should be about one blink
per second and then it turns off
if it blinks faster than one per second
that means your vehicle has reached the
maximum number of keys that can be
programmed and you need more
sophisticated equipment to erase any
keys that have been lost
all right
there we go after 60 seconds it stops
blinking this key is now programmed
you can take it to a locksmith
they''ll charge you a few dollars to cut
it to match your existing key it''s that
easy
the blinking light means there''s not a
valid key
in the ignition if we put this existing
one in the blinking light turns off
put this one in the bling lights turns
off
so there you have it that''s programmed
all right let''s take a look at doing the
remote i do want to point out that
process will work for a regular key like
this without a remote i''ll sell these on
tomsky.com
programming the remotes
equally easy we''re going to take our
existing working key
put it on turn it two clicks to the on
position
have the programmer you slide it over to
where it will be labeled with remote
setting
we''re gonna plug it in it''s gonna start
beeping

put this on as you can see this is First
Position which lights are not
on this is the second position which is
the one that turns on the
lights okay so now let''s go ahead and do
everything that we need to
do next we''re going to go ahead and
enter the car and make sure that you
have all doors are closed if the doors
are not closed the programming is not
going to be
well now in order to program your key
fob we are going to work on position one
and on position two only
so position two is where you''re going to
press the lock button and once you go
back you only go back to position one
you are not going to turn it off all the
way besides the noise that you''re going
to hear that you always hear before
turning on the car when the lights go on
you''re also going to hear like a little
beep on the background that means that
the signal is catching in in order to
perform
the programming so we need to do this
four times so let''s go ahead and start
we''re going straight to position
two lock go
back position two again
click go back position three two go back
position one position two and this time
we''re going to hear the
locks you hear the locks now press it
again
now the key fob is
programmed and once you turn off the
car that makes it 100% so now let let''s
let''s go
check and it
locks
voila now that you know how to program
your Honda''s key fob and remote key let

Rogue customer lost the only key
so uh we''ll have to create it from
scratch the car is locked so we''ll have
to pick the lock open and for this one
we''re going to use the leashing let''s
start
all right we need to open a Nissan Rogue
2020 we''re gonna use a lychee
Anderson 14.
and uh
we''re gonna pick the lock open
[Applause]
so on this lichi we have 10
numbers from 1 to 10.
but in the door there is only from 3 to
10.
so first I''m going to slide it in
make sure that everything
is springy
that''s a tight lock very tight lock
but
all right now I''m going to put a little
bit of pressure
and every every wafer that''s binding I''m
gonna pick
[Music]
and this is how it''s picked
so now the door is open
all right after we open the door
we can start working on the ignition to
make a key
so the ignition is a pushed to start and
uh
what we''re going to do is we''re going to
create a universal
remote for this vehicle
I''m going to use otel km100
in order to generate it all right
so I''m using a
Hotel Universal Remote
so I''m using a universal remote I need
to put a battery inside there is a
battery
so now first I need to because it''s a
universal it can fit many models and
years
first we want to make sure that we write
it to this specific group of vehicles
and then we can program it to the car so
I''m going to go to Universal key
I''m gonna go to
Nissan
I''m gonna go to Rogue
I can look up here
and we have 19 to 2022 but she had five
buttons this is the one with the five
buttons
so we''re gonna go this one
19 to 22 433 megahertz
and it has the five buttons I''m gonna do
generate Universal key
now that''s going to take
about three minutes to write it down and
then we can go and program it to the
vehicle foreign
the universally transform it to a Nissan
Rogue FCC like the same serial number
if I want another key I can put another
one and hit continue but since I''m only
doing one key I''m gonna hit completed
now what I like to do before
I go to the vehicle I would like to test
that there is a good battery in the
remote and also I can see the frequency
that it transmits now it says that it
should be 433 so that means the 434
should turn on
so the yellow light turns on that means
it registered to the right frequency so
now I''m gonna go ahead and program it to
the vehicle
so I''m gonna connect
the uh connector the dongle
to the OBD which is right underneath
here
and I''m gonna have a seat
first of all
I''m going to connect
connected to the dongle
there you go
all right so now we are still here so
instead of going back to the main menu
and coming and going again in the menu
to find the uh the the immobilizer you
have the button here immobilizer so it''s
gonna already choose the year make and
model
all right turn on the Azure lights
turn on the ignition if the ignition
cannot be turned on press ok to continue
of course we don''t have a key so it
cannot turn on
just gonna check to make sure that the
key is not here it says key ID incorrect
they do not have a key pair
all right now what we''re gonna do is
we''re gonna go to heart function
smart key learning
it''s gonna ask for the pin it''s going to
read it by itself execution for this
function will erase all learn keys of
the vehicle prepare all keys in the
vehicle at most Four Keys can be learned
you want to continue yes
turn on turn off the ignition turn on
the other lights open and closed the
driver door
okay
all right the BCM code is
for twenty
okay so there is a risk between 2014 and
17 but we are 20 20 so there is no
problem
all right
place the original smart key against the
ignition so I''m gonna put it right here
next to the start button without pushing
it
and hit OK
I''m gonna hear two beeps
okay so now we need to to push the
ignition on
very short push and we''re gonna see the
red security light blink five times but
I''m gonna push it with
with the start key so and I leave it
next to it
there you go one two three four five so
that''s already registered
I''m gonna do okay on the thing on the
machine and it''s going to tell me turn
off the ignition
I''m gonna press again to turn it off and
hit OK program success continue to
program the next one no
all right so it says press and hold
press the start button and attach the

within five seconds to the instrument
automatically will light up so I''m gonna
press it

                             VALUES ('lZT-4Je_6eE', 'All right. Today it''s time to program a
another Nissan. Uh, currently we have a
2022 Nissan Maxima. So, I got a new
aftermarket fob here. Uh, actually, this
one might be a OEM refurb. I''m not
sure. I can''t remember what I bought.
But, uh, anyway, we''re going to be using
the IM 608. So, we''re going to go into
the Nissan system. First of all, I''m
going tell you guys some things to to
watch for as you''re programming it to
make sure everything goes smooth.
Nissan''s are pretty basic. Um, there''s
not a lot you have to do. The only thing
you really have to concern yourself with
is to remember that when you do
programming on Nissan, no matter what,
you always erase any keys that are in
the system and you add in new ones. Um,
so if a customer doesn''t have all their
keys present, you have to let them know,
say, hey, any key that''s not present
will not be added back into the system
and they will need to be reprogrammed.
Now, um, also you you don''t really use a
used key, like you can reset them and
whatnot, but if it''s an original key for
the car, then you can reuse a used one
as long as it''s original for that car,
like it''s been programmed to that car
before. Uh, so what was this? A
2022. But other than that, everything is
really straightforward. So, this is,
like I said, this is a OEM unlock, I
believe, because it''s got the logo.
Um, this is
a repo car, so there''s no need to worry
about any other
keys. All right, so this is saying to
open and close the door. I I don''t never
do that, but I will turn on the hazards.
Basically, we just want to wake up the
BCM to make sure that, you know, it''s
active and we can communicate with
it. And the flashers are good because I
believe they make the BCM stay awake.
So, like if you were to just hit the
start button, that also wakes up the
system, but it can go back to sleep
while you''re trying to communicate. So,
we turn the hazards on just to keep the
system
awake. Sometimes if the battery is too
low, I''ll actually cut those off. You
don''t have to have them on for the
programming, but every once in a while,
you''ll want to hit the start button just
to keep the system active if you do
that. Okay? And if if you look on the
screen, you''ll see it says to place the
key near the start switch. That''s
important because now we know that the
start switch is the sensing portion for
the proximity. So when we program it,
that''s where we''ll have to add it. Now
all Nissan are like that. That''s nothing
nothing special for Nissan, but for
other cars, that can be very helpful,
especially some of the Kia where they
have different areas. It''s like some
will have the button, some will have the
little area in a slot. So that that
information when you see it is very nice
to have. Okay. So we''re going to go into
the remote. We''re going to do smart key
learning. All this is
done. This says to click okay. And then
immediately hit the start button with
the key. And you don''t have to use the
key to push it down. You just have to
have it close. But we''ll we''ll do we''ll
do it that way just to be sure. Okay.
Okay. So, we''re going to come over here
and do just like
that. And then it says to hold the
ignition down until the dash comes on,
which it did, which is good. That means
it unlocked the
steering the steering lock, which we
needed to do for
programming. Okay. So, it was good. So,
I''m going to hit
okay. And now, we''re going to turn the
switch off. Okay. We see the dash cut
off. We come back here. We''re going to
hit okay. So now it
says
that we have to hit the logo of the key
onto the button and wait. So what we''re
going to do is we''re going to hit
okay. All
right. Actually, it says just to It says
not to hit okay. Let''s not hit okay.
Okay. So the first thing we want to do
here is we want to hit the button. And
you''re going to see this start flashing.
Once that starts flashing, you take and
hold your key to it and it will read
your key and we''ll see the dash come on.
Right? So, I''m hold the key away. You
see it flashing. Now, I''m going to hold
my key here and the dash should come
on. And if you notice there, we saw the
security light, which was right there,
flash five times. That''s perfect for
Nissan''s. That means that it was reading
the key and programming the body control
module with the key ID. Okay. So, now
we''re going to cut the switch off. Let''s
wait a little bit. Not too long. About
about 3 to 5 seconds. All right. And
then we''re going to do it again. We''re
going to push
it. We''re going to
wait. Okay. And we see that it done it
again.
Same thing except we didn''t see the
immobilizer light this time which is
perfect. That''s what we want. Okay. So,
we''ll go ahead and turn it off now. And
we see on the dash key registration
complete. So, at this point, you don''t
even need to hit okay on your machine.
It''s actually already done in the
system. And this is
just, you know, the system''s own
message. Okay. And if you wanted to add
more keys, you could. I''m not going to.
I''m just going to hit next. And this is
all done. So, we can cut this off. So,
2022 Nissan Maxima
um OEM Refurb. I believe I got this from
American Key Supply. That''s generally
where I get them from. Um I met the
owner a long long time ago and he was a
really nice guy. So, I just always kind
of stuck with them. I know a lot of
people have trouble, but uh I have never
had any issues with them. So, lock and
unlock is working.
Okay, let''s make sure it starts
up. I''m reaching on the dash for the
button. Okay. Yeah, there we go. You see
the RPM gauge go
up and key number one
detected.

to program a smart key
for kia and hyundai that are using this
smart key
right now for this video i''m sitting
inside 2013
kia sportage and what i''m going to do
i''m going to program this key and i will
do it step by step
it''s important to mention that
all the vehicles that are using this key
the programming procedure is exactly the
same
one thing that is important to mention
before i start is that in order to
program this key
we must have a security code the
security code ready to go because once
we''re going to program the key the
computer will ask us to input the
security code and we must have it ready
so you can get the security code in
different ways
personally i just got it from a code
company you can get it through nastaf or
if you have a different way but you just
need to have it ready for the
programming process at this
a right now this is the security code
that i''m going to use once i program the
key
and it''s important to mention that every
key will have its own security code so
this security code will not going to be
for all cars it''s just gonna be for this
car
okay so with that being said let''s go to
the programming process and let''s see
how we do it step by step hi i''m ocean
i''m sorry to interrupt your video i know
it''s a pain in the ass but look i wanna
tell you something important i can tell
that you''re really interested in
learning about how to program car keys
and remotes well that''s what we do in

you can become as professional as i am
on your first day and on your first try
i don''t think you can afford to be
without it
okay so the first thing that we need to
do
we need to connect the obd cable adapter
to the obd port which is located
underneath the steering column
okay and once i connect it i can take a
look and see that the lights came on and
that''s good indicator meaning that there
is a electricity in the vehicle and now
we can go to the programming process
[Music]
[Applause]
okay so i''m going to turn on the proper
the first thing
and after i turn the proper to the on
position
i''m checking here and i see that the
light the bluetooth light came to blue
that''s good sign meaning that there is a
connection between the bluetooth adapter
and the proped and i can start the
programming process
okay so of course before everything i
make sure that i''m in immobilization at
the top track symbol at the bottom and
the bluetooth here is on
and i''m going to choose kia
in the disclaimer i press agree
and in this screen what i''m going to
choose i''m going to choose program
immobilizer or remote
and in this screen i''m going to choose
select from type
and because i''m doing a smart key system
i''m going to choose smart key system
and because i''m in the us i will choose
usa
okay in this screen we have few options
we have type 1 with card slot type 2
with card slot type 3 without card slot
type 4 without card slot so in this
vehicle i do have a programming slot
in the computer call it a card slot so
it have to be between type 1 and type 2.
i don''t even know which one is it so
what i''m gonna choose i''m gonna choose
type one and if it doesn''t work i will
choose type two so let''s start
type one
turn off the ignition switch press okay
to continue the ignition switch the
start button is already off so will
press ok
turn on hazard warning lights press ok
to continue so i will press on the
hazard warning light and we''ll press ok
ok right now it did pass to the second
screen so what i''m going to do i''m going
to do program smart keys
and in this screen it gives me different
location where the programming slot can
be
in a
in my vehicle the programming slot
located between the driver side and the
passenger side on the armrest
so a but in different vehicle it''s in
different positions so you can check in
your vehicle and see where it is so what
i''m gonna do i''m gonna open the smart
the the the armrest and i take the key
and i just
push it inside the programming slot
until i hear the click i need to push it
all the way this face down
all the way until i hear the click
okay
now when the card is inside i will press
ok
and the
the request was rejected and the status
was incorrect i will press ok and i will
take out
the key from the programming slot
and what i''m going to do i''m going to go
back
and in this option i will choose type 2
with card slot
and i will turn the hazard warning light
off because i''m choosing a different one
and
it tells me turn off the ignition switch
press ok to continue the ignition is
already off i''ll press ok
to continue so again i''m going to press
on the house of the warning light and we
press ok to continue
fail to connect i will press ok and i
will do it again
and we''ll do it again and we press okay
okay and as you can see sometime it
failed to connect but don''t worry just
say you can do it again until it get you
to the next line
the next step and if it doesn''t take you
to the next step what you can do you can
disconnect the machine
the obd and connect it again and start
the whole process from the beginning
sometime cars and computer react this
way and we just need to live with that
so in this screen what i''m going to
choose i''m going to choose program smart
keys
and again it tells me the different
location that the programming slot can
be so we need to insert the key to the
programming slot so what i''m going to do
i''m going to open the armrest
and i take the a program in
the the smart key i need to push it in
to the programming slot so that''s what
i''m going to do now
okay push it in until it click and what
i''m going to do i''m going to press ok
and right now i need to input the
security code
remember that i have the security code
ready in this car is 366 906
okay so let''s put it in
six 366.
nine
o
six
and i''ll press done
okay the computer tell me a program
success whether to program next one
press yes to continue press no to return
i will press no because i just want to
program one
and please exit system check the smart
key if programmed or not i''ll press ok
and what i''m going to do now i will
turn off the hazard warning light and i
will click the pro the the key
in and it will take the key outside of
the programming slot and what i can do i
can test the key
and the key is not a responding yet but
don''t worry what i can do i can press on
the break and on the start stop engine
and it''s not responding yet but that''s
what happened is that sometimes when you
program a new key for kia or hyundai
it''s take a few moments until the
computer realize that the key is
actually programmed so what i can do i
can just disconnect
the machine
press on the brake and try to start the
engine and as you can see the engine
just started
so
basically
if this situation happened to you one
moment
i will turn it to the off position and
now i can check the remote
lock
unlock
unlock and basically that''s it the keys
program and
if this situation happened for you
that can happen sometimes take few
moments until the computer realize that
the key is actually programmed and
sometime you also need to disconnect the
obd cable adapter before the car can
actually start the engine so in your car
you will see what you need to do but
don''t get panic this situation sometimes
happen and basically that''s how you
program a smart key
for a kia or hyundai that''s using this
smart key and basically that''s it for

going to show you how to calculate a
Hyundai or kia password using the xhorse
key tool
Max for this to work you''ll need the key
tool Max itself either a working key or
a key blank if it''s all keys lost and
internet
connection what we''re going to do is on
the main menu for the key tool we''re
going to select transponder
clone we''re going to hit the Clone
button where we''re going to see a couple
options
here now you''re going to have to do your
research and verify that you have the
right transponder type because your
instructions are going to
vary this is
id46 so we''re going to select id46
online calculation and hit start
clone from here we see a couple more
options including Kia Hyundai
password where it''s now asking us to put
our key into the antenna the key
tool now you will need internet for this
part to work and it will take a bit of
time okay so from here we do have a
couple more
options we''ll do original key clone
recommended
now it''s asking us for data acquisition
for the key tool antenna to go up to it
looks like an
ignition this is a push to start vehicle
where we do not have an actual ignition
so here''s what we''re going to be doing
you have a push to start button right
here that''s not going to be doing
anything this is a 2010 kou and you''ll
notice that it has a slot right
here this is where our key is going to
go so I''m going to position the key
tool to be in range of that slot and I
should just have to take the
key and put it in
there so the key has now been
inserted we can pull the key out and our
key tool is asking us to place the key
back into the antenna ring so let''s go
ahead and do that and see what it
does so now it''s calculating the data
essentially since this key is programmed
to the
car you put it into the emergency start
slot and it''s going to acquire the
password through that connection of the
key and the key
slot now this works on all keys lost as
well and there we have
it smart key password 820 358 with this
password we could add keys do all keys
lost and uh get that programmed I hope

episode of the DIY guide.net all right
today we''re going to be showing you how
to reprogram your key fob for your older
Subaru uh this is a 2000 Outback this
procedure is going to work on a legacy
or Outback 99 to 2004 a Forester 01 to
2004 and your Impreza 02 to 04 now the
colored button remote like this here is
for an 02 to 04 if you had just the gray
buttons that''s a 99 to 01 uh the remotes
are interchangeable I believe I know I
programmed a colored remote like this to
an older Subaru not for the year that
it''s supposed to be so we''re going to
program this colored remote which is the
O2 to4 to a 2000
Outback so if you have a 2005 and newer
Subaru you want to click the link in the
bottom right hand
corner so let''s get
started all right so we''re going to get
in the vehicle in the driver''s seat want
to make sure that all the doors your
trunk or tailgate are closed you want to
make sure that they''re all in the
unlocked position
so next to start we''re going to open and
close the driver''s door after we close
the door we''re going to take the key
Stick in ignition go from the off
position to the on position and back to
the off position 10 times now we don''t
want to start the vehicle we just want
the dash lights to come on we need to do
this very quickly uh at which time if we
do it correctly in in the amount of time
the horn is going to honk one time to
let you know you started the programming
mode once you hear that horn honk we''re
going to open and close the driver''s
door once you close the the door you''re
going to press any button on the key fob
you want to program at which time you''re
going to hear the horn honk twice you
want to program additional remotes
you''re going to open and close the
driver''s door and press any button on
the next remote you want to program you
can program up to four remotes once
you''re done programming remotes you''re
going to pull the key from the ignition
at which time the horn will honk three
times to let you know you''ve done it
successfully so let''s get started
so we heard it beep once we''ll open and
close the
door press any button on the fob we want
to
program we heard it beep twice so we''re
only programming this one so we''re going
to pull the key from the if you''re going
to program another one you''d open the
door and press the button on the next
remote to be programmed so we should
hear the horn honk three
times so now that we heard the horn honk
three times this should be programmed
successfully to this car
we''re going to go wait a couple seconds
and then we''ll go ahead and test it so
we''ll press the lock button
first as you could hear it locked uh you
can also see the security light on the
dash hopefully blinking away we''ll go
ahead and press
unlock and it functions as it should so

$500 to make a spare key fob and tells
me to spend two hours of my time sitting
in their waiting room that''s crazy you
need another key for your Mazda vehicle
my Mike with Tom''s key compan I to show
you just how easy it is to make a spare
key without leaving home with the help
of tomsk key.com we''ve got solutions for
thousands of different Vehicles so come
check us out before we jump in the car
and show you what''s going to happen be
sure you stick around to the end of the
video I''m going to call the Mazda dealer
ship and ask them how much they want to
rip me off for to make a spare key so
let''s jump in the car okay we''re going
to program today you''ve got to have one
working key that starts the engine in my
case that''s this tile keyfinder it
doesn''t have the buttons on it do not
have to work but it''s got to be able to
start the engine and this is the spare
key we''re going to program with the
yellow key tag there''s one very
important thing with many mozda vehicles
you''ve got to get the right FCC ID
number on your spare key so stick around
later in the video I''m going to tell you
how to find that out but for now let''s
get going programming okay we got to
fire up the app and then have to scan
the barcode with the serial number not
the help barcode on the
back okay there we go tells us some
important things you need a solid
internet connection we''ve got to have
all keys both existing and new have
repairing tool and no caution or warning
the aftermarket components may cause
problems so if you have an aftermarket
alarm system aftermarket remote start
things like that you might run into some
problems so so proceed at your own risk
okay let''s look up our vehicle this is a
Mazda 3 and it''s 2014 so right there
okay asking what kind of key we have
there''s only one option with this
vehicle a smart key meaning you use a
start button so we got our smart key
looks like we need download a data pack
from
Mazda okay we''re ready to go for Mazda
got to plug in the pairing tool you got
to find the OBD2 port to plug this in if
you don''t know where that is don''t worry
it''s not too hard come down down to your
gas and brake pedal look up there you go
sometimes it''ll be under a panel up here
but usually it''s just pretty easy to
access so plug in to make your life a
little bit easier I recommend picking up
this optional extension cable then you
can see what''s happening with the
programmer with this guy here we''ve got
to get our pairing made let''s come into
our bluetooth settings okay once it''s
paired we should see a green light turn
blue there we go we''ve got the
programmer paired and the app also
indicates it''s paired okay timing is
everything on this so pay close
attention if things go too slow you may
have to start over at the beginning turn
on the ignition within 30 seconds so I''m
going to push the start button once
twice till the dash lights turn on and
the vehicle has power but the engine is
not running we got to have the original
key okay here''s my original key we need
to start the engine stepping on the
brake engine has started
okay next this programmer is going to
connect to the VIN of the vehicle so
it''s now tied to the VIN of this vehicle
you can only program keys for one
vehicle with one programmer but you can
program multiple Keys Turn Off the
ignition okay ignition is
off turn on the ignition don''t press the
brake pedal so same thing I''m going to
click twice dashboard lights
up hit next important notes here this is
not going to erase existing keys and up
to six keys can be paired so we''re going
to pair one it''s communicating with the
vehicle all right pairing the first key
press for automatic transmission or
manual transmission you need to push the
brake and then put the smart key up
within 15 seconds Touch where the logo
would be notice it says we''ve got five
Keys currently pairing Keys it says we
now have six Keys turn the ignition off
within 30 seconds so this vehicle has
lots of keys already paired to it we now
have six in the world and you can stick
around the end to see one of the
problems I caused with one of those we
got to turn the ignition off here''s our
newly paired key I''m pressing down the
brake I''m holding it up here for 3
seconds and then I''m going to
press it
on the engine fires up and key pairing
is complete
notice I''ve got a blinking security
light going still I''m going to turn off
the engine now I''m going to take my
original key I''m going to push the start
stop button with the original key hold
it down engine fires up
okay we go ahead and turn off the engine
now I''m going to take this newly paired
key I''m going to do the same thing hold
the brake put it up to the start stop
button fire up the
engine that little
procedure that flashing security light
has stopped okay now let''s check and see
if the these guys work okay there''s two
things we want to test if it starts the
engine and if the remote buttons work so
let''s check the buttons first I get this
guy
unplugged
okay let''s see if the buttons work
here''s the original key locks and
unlocks the doors here''s a new key locks
and unlocks the doors look at that isn''t
that amazing okay to make sure they
start the engine we''ve got to get all
the keys out of the
vehicle set the keys away from the
vehicle and try to start the engine if I
try to start it now nothing happens and
so we know it''s far enough away can''t
sense any Keys notice I''m getting this
blinking red security
light okay is not working so now that we
know we''ve got the keys far enough away
we''ll bring them back in one at a
time here''s the original key obviously
it still needs to work boom fires up the
engine
beautiful let''s get this out of the
vehicle okay now we''ve got the new key
Moment of
Truth fires up the engine look at that

going to charge to make a spare key how
can I help you I''m trying to find out
how much it''s going to cost to make
another key fob for A4 Mazda to give me
one moment okay awesome thanks just on a
hold now
how much do you think they''re going to
quote about 500 bucks maybe it''s
$400
$450 think I''m going on hold for few
minutes now they''re somewhere around 400
bucks because the part of the remote is
like $230 and the labor is $190 what how
how long does that take takes about two
hours $190 to make the spare key said
plan on a couple hours down there it''s
going to take half my day by the time I
drive down drive back the service guy
couldn''t get the parts department to
answer let''s see if I can get them to
answer I''m trying to find out how much
it costs for a key fob for a 2014 Mazda
okay look like the fob itself
26703 plus programming okay does that
include the keyblade the metal emergency
keyblade in it keyblade 30 304 all right
so what''s that all add up to 297
2977 297 okay thank you so much for the
information I appreciate it so there you
have
$297 plus tax to get a new new key fob
from the Mazda dealership plus $190 on
top of that I spent 10 or 11 minutes on
the phone getting my quote and
appointment in order to get this new key
fob made can you believe the Mazda
dealership wanted over $500 to make a
spare key fob and they said it was going

ship it all back you''ll get a full

easy I invited you to stick around to
see the problem I ran into a few days
ago here''s what happened to me so we can
make sure it doesn''t happen to you let
me back up quickly and just show you the
abbreviated version of programming this
key and how I found that I had the a bad
circuit board or the wrong fcci ID
number here we go here''s the 5-second
version of me programming this
key okay that was it key pairings
complete now watch as I go to test this
key and see what happens take a look at
the buttons check the lock see it''s not
unlocking the other ones all work but
this one didn''t if we try to start the
engine with this let''s get all the keys
out of the
vehicle okay this is the only key in the
vehicle now if I try to start the
engine it doesn''t work now nothing
happens we just get the blinking green
light on the push button start and the
flashing red security light on the dash
look what happens if I hold it next to
the start
button the start button lights up green
and we get a green security light so
that''s kind of interesting because it
allows me to start the engine well
here''s what''s happening the chip inside
this key has been programmed and it can
be sensed by the vehicle computer when
the key is held right next to the start
button that''s very helpful in cases if
your fob battery has died or the circuit
board has been damaged you''ll still be
able to start the engine by holding the
key up to the start button and pressing
[Music]
it however it also mean because the
buttons don''t work and the the ability
to send the signal here doesn''t work
means the circuit board is either
damaged or more likely it''s the wrong
circuit board it''s for vehicles that
fcci ID ending in d02 so that''s why it''s
really important to verify the fcci ID
number of your original key I recommend
grabbing your phone zoom in snap a photo
and then if you look carefully you will
see the FCC ID in this case it ends with
the letter d01
now what if you don''t have an OEM key
you''re not going to have the fcci listed
the thing to do there is to call the
dealership ask for the parts department
tell them the VIN number of the vehicle
and ask them what key you need tell them
you need to find out the fcci ID if it
ends in d01 or d02 if they don''t give it
to you try calling another monster
dealership you may have to try two or
three they just want you to come in and
get ripped off check out my video where
I demon rate that with hidden cameras so
the good news is this key with blue tag
is always an emergency backup and the
bad news none of the buttons work and
it''s pretty inconvenient come to tomsk

                             VALUES ('VJi04xiBn0c', 'Hello everyone. I have just a very quick
DIY video. In this DIY video, I''m going
to show you how to reprogram a key. Some
keys you''ll have um any of these diamond
keys for BMW E39, E46 will actually lose
its connection to the car. So, you''ll
press the unlock button. If I press it,
mine still works, but some of them
aren''t working. So, in this video, I''m
just going to actually show you how to
reprogram this key. key if you already
have an existing key that''s working on
the car. I''m going to show you how to
program the key. And I think this also
works for new keys that have the same um
the actual key pattern with this. I
think this will work for to actually
link it up to the car to unlock and
lock. It will not start the car if if
this key hasn''t previously started the
car. Like this car will start the car
cuz of the other chip in it, but it will
it um it just doesn''t unlock and lock
the car. So, I''ll show you in this video
exactly what is needed to do that. All
you need is your key. And to start off,
get in your car, make sure both your
doors are closed. I have just a coupe,
so there''s only two doors, but if you
have a four-door car, make sure all four
doors are closed, and then proceed with
this. Make sure they''re not open because
it will not work and it will not put it
into the reprogramming mode or pairing
mode for the car. So, I''ll be back in
the next clip to show you exactly how to
start doing this. So, to start off,
again, I''m just going to make sure to
tell you guys to make sure your doors
are closed, and what you''re going to do
is you''re going to take your key, put it
into I''ll demonstrate in a second, but
you''re going to put it into the key
slot, turn it one, click to position
one, and turn it back off, and pull it
with remove it within 5 seconds. So,
basically, you''re going to go like this.
You''re going to take it in,
take it right out. I''ll do that again
for you. So, I basically went
in, click, one, click, back out. And
basically to tell that you''re in
position one, I''ll show you how to tell
if you''re position one. So, if I put the
key in and if I go like that, that''s
position one where just the service um
this the oil light lights up with your
mileage and the radio is on like that.
No AC controls, no dash clusters. This
is position two. As you can see, all my
lights come on. This is what we we don''t
want. We just want it to look like this.
So that''s position one. So again, you''re
going to take the key,
put it in, one click, take it back out
within 5 seconds. And now I will show
you the next part of what you actually
have to do. I''m going to try to show you
in my lap of what you have to do. And
I''ll be back with that. So one thing I
for forgot to actually mention in the
beginning of this video, when you start,
make sure that your door your car doors
are both shut. All four of them or two
of them if you have a coupe. And also
make sure your w your doors are
unlocked. So to do this now, you''re what
you''re gonna do is you''re gonna hold the
unlock button and then press the BMW
button. You''re gonna press it. You''re
gonna go hold it and press the BMW
button three times with about two second
break in between. So I''ll show you how
I''m going to do that right now. So, I''m
going to hold down the the lock button,
and I''m going to go one,
two,
three, and your doors
should cycle the lock just like they
did. And now you''re done. And you can
reprogram as many keys as you want. But
one thing that I like to do after, you
don''t have to do this, just reinsert the
key back into um the car. I mean, I
don''t know if it''s necessary. You''re
just going to reinsert it back into
position one again.
One 5 seconds within 5 seconds and pull
it back off just like I just did. Um,
it''s a pretty basic DIY. It might take
you a couple times to actually do the
part where you have to um
do the hold down the buttons where you
have to hold down the unlock button and
then while holding the unlock button you
have to press the uh the BMW button
three times. You have to go one, two,
three. That might take you a couple
times and you might and you have to do
that within 30 seconds of a actually
pulling out the key. So, I mean, just do
it in one sequence. It''s enough time for
you to do it. It''s really not that
difficult, but again, it might take you
a couple times. If you just follow my
instructions, you''ll be all set and you
will be able to reprogram a a key that
does not work and make it working. Um,
that''s it for this DIY. It''s a very
short DIY, very easy. If you think your
batteries may be dead, try repairing it
first. And it might take you a couple
times to repair it, but odds are that
will fix the issue because when you
actually put this key into the ignition
like this, when I put it into the
ignition, it''s charging the battery in
the key, which is a really cool concept
for BMW. It''s charging the battery in
the key right now, just having it in the
ignition. So maybe you''re it just lost
the pair, the signal that''s used for,
and you can try this. This works on any
of these diamond shaped keys for any of
the BMW E46s, E39, E um
and E53.
I don''t know if it''s anything else, but
I know those ones are it. But thank you
guys so much for watching. Don''t forget

do an oky lost situation for a 2013 uh
E-class using uh the alel we''re going to
be using the XP
400 with uh the
emulator connected to the XP
400 uh to the
alel um and we''re going to be adding an
aftermarket
key
we''re going to be using the two
batteries
one so it''s a
eClass we''re going to start by just
logging into the car the car has an
active
alarm uh so it''s an OSS
situation um so anyway we not going to
know how we need to connect I always
recommend just connect to the car
through the
OBD and we''re going to go to Mercedes
after we''re going to do
that
um we''re going to be uh going and doing
it
by smart
selection always going to be the easiest
for you guys because it''s going to tell
us exactly what it is and we''re going to
go for all key lost
fast and we going to be using a Gbox
just to make it
faster but sometimes on model uh it''s
going to be uh no fast option you''re
just going to be able to do the slow
option so as you can see on this one is
a W uh
212 and it''s a model year
13 so all KOST is currently unsupported
in this uh version so the way we''re
going to do that we just going to go to
the all kilos and a regular version on
vehicle
so we''re just going to hit
again and now it ask us to put the blank
key so just for your recommendation uh I
know some of the keys are bad are using
the double battery ones appearance to be
working way better so it''s asked us to
put it in the IR IR radi is basically
this you''re going to see a infrared
inside and we''re just going to hit
okay it''s reading the key is making sure
the key is uh
blank so ask us if we have a password so
we don''t it''s an oy lost we''re going to
press okay to enter the calculation
uh now it''s going to ask us to um
connect the OBD and everything which we
already did so basically the OBD is here
USB to the XP 400 XP 400 as this cable
which is apb1 125 that''s the emulator we
just going to place it in the ignition
and we''re going to hit
begin
just going to hit
okay
okay it''s told us to do everything we
did already so now it''s connecting to
obtain
data keep in mind that Mercedes say is
really about luck uh when we talking so
now I wants us to put in and out the
emulator so after we did that we went
into public calculation now uh sometimes
it can take it could be a nightmare it
can take like really really long time it
really depends on your
luck uh server internet
connection uh but anyways um I have
experience that it took from 2 seconds
or like maybe 2 minutes all the way to
sometimes even like 2 hours uh rarely
but normally it will be between the 20
minutes or so I will get back to you
guys uh when I get the password and I
will show you how we
proceed so I would say about uh 20
minutes into the calculation uh we have
got the password so after you get a
password uh you just want to take a
photo of that just to keep it uh for
future reference and then we''re going to
just hit
okay so the passport uh calculation is
completed we''re just going to press okay
to keep
going um it''s going to generate the key
file so generating a key file basically
means that it takes the Eis uh data and
the code and it''s basically writing a
new key slot for this key and now we''re
going to write the key uh file into the
key itself so we''re basically going to
put the key into the IR we''re going to
press the okay it''s detecting the key
and this is the moment that it''s
basically writing the
so it''s writing a key
file and after it''s going to do that we
are basically
done um so as you can see in this
chassis and the
w2000
212 the job uh is not being done with
taking the elv or anything thing you
just OBD and you go on the OBD slow and
we''re just going to take the key now
we''re going to put it in the
ignition and we''re going to turn
it and as you can
see so we''re going to add some power to
the car and we''re going to
make so after hooking a battery

American Key Supply presents the first
in-depth tutorial to help you be
successful in the field when picking and
then decoding locks with Ley twoin one
picks and
decoders our resident expert with Ley
tools Mahar Eid finally breaks it down
so you can gain proficiency and
confidence here we
go General tips
number one learn a little about your
lock first find out before getting on
site what kind of lock you''ll be working
on and which tool you''ll need also if
the lock is missing any wafers in any
positions and if the lock decodes in the
same direction as it was picked the best
way to find this information is by
looking in the new Ley 2in1 user guide
by Tony
odley
number two practice increase your
confidence by successfully picking and
decoding a few locks before doing it in
the field with customers staying over
your shoulder go to your local junkyard
and see if you can find some door locks
that will help you practice vws h66
BMW''s two track h92 BMW for track h258
are some that are particularly useful
for practicing for the real world also
the leasy training Vice is very helpful
for practicing on any kind of
lock number three keep track of what
you''re doing try to remember which wafer
picked in which direction this is
important information to remember when
it''s time to decode the
lock number four use only genuine Ley
tools there are many imitators and
although they may look identical they
break easily and are not accurate making
picking and decoding more difficult
purchase your Ley tools only from actual
leasy distributors in your
country steps and rules for picking all
locks follow these same basic rules
while
picking number one insert the tool into
the
lock pull the slide back before
inserting move the slide all the way
back and center before inserting into
lock make sure the tools fully inserted
if you are not feeling any spring
resistance for positions in either
direction or if both sides are blocked
chances are your tool is just not pushed
in all the
way
two determine which Wafers are on which
side cycle through the positions without
any turning tension to see where the
spring back is felt if you don''t feel
any spring bag that''s probably the wrong
direction
number three turn towards either
direction like a residential lock
picking can be done in either direction
but One Direction will always be easier
than the other if you find picking is
difficult try changing
directions number four if it Springs one
depth it''s picked leave it
alone springing back just one step is
how you know you''ve picked this wafer be
gentle if you push these too far it will
become overp picked and you will have to
start all
over
number five if you can push it all the
way down and feel it Springs all depths
skip it and come back to it
later number six if it stops and you
feel no spring push gently until it
clicks past and becomes
picked if it''s difficult to push do not
force it try releasing tension slowly
until it clicks
number seven keep going through each
position until all Wafers are
picked even for positions that you
determine were already picked keep
trying them again each time until the
plug
turns
number eight in most cases you will need
to add more turning pressure as each
position becomes
picked
all
right so first step after getting into
lock you want to make sure you kind of
have a general idea of where all the
Wafers are so uh with no
tension you want to uh just get a feel
for where everything is so eight is
going to be up there''s nothing down
Seven''s going to be up nothing
down six nothing
up Springs
down five nothing
up five''s
down Four''s
up three is
up two is is
down one is down so we
know 78 are going to be up 5 six down
four and three are going to be up two
and one are going to be down
so apply a little bit of
turning
pressure and
just very gently start picking that
one''s very stiff so pick it until it
bounces when it bounces one depth like
this you know it''s picked so you go on
to the next one Seven''s going to be
up Seven''s
picked six is
down it Springs the
full depths so come back to it later
five very gently you can see it''s
already pick so it must be a very high
depth just leave it alone don''t touch it
four
Bo this one might have to come back and
check on it
later
three
stiff pick it and now it Springs the
full depth so it come back to it later
two little stiff but picked
over now one is very stiff this is where
a lot of people break their tools to get
one to pick you want to let go a little
bit of tension here until
it
picks now it''s picked probably want to
check on that one later too so go
through it all again Eight''s
picked Seven''s picked and each time you
pick you want to add just a little bit
more turning
pressure six still nothing come back
later five is still
picked four still picked
three is very
stiff come back to a later now
two picked a little bit more turning
pressure one still
picked eight
seven Seven''s now
six picked a little bit more turning
pressure
five still
picked four is picked three
stiff two
stiff now picked one it''s picked so now
should be only
one holding it away from
oh there it
is now it''s
picked rules for
decoding number one refer to the Lei
2in1 user guide by Tony odley to
determine if decoding is done in the
same or opposite direction as picking
lock in the h66 locks for example if you
pick the wafer by pushing upwards you
would decode that wafer by pushing
downwards in the opposite
direction number two push until it stops
and take a reading it does not require
heavy pressure to find your depth yes if
you push hard enough you can make it
read deeper but that''s a wrong
reading
and so
now you want to decode and for the
h266 we picked 8 and seven up and how we
know that there''s a little
springing but uh you want to decode
down and so without any pressure on it
you can see it''s about a
it''s about a
three so then go to seven seven was
picked up so we decode down and it is a
two six was picked down so we decode
up and it looks like a
two five was picked down so we decode up
and it looks like a
three actually Four
four was picked up we decode down and it
is dead on
three three was picked up decode down it
is a
one two was picked down decode up it''s a
one one was picked down decode up it''s a
things to be careful
of number one do not ever force a tool
it should not take much pressure to pick
each position too much force will break
the tip of your tool and the tips are
not replaceable not only will pushing
too hard break your tool but you won''t
be able to make any money from your
customer be gentle with your
tool number two do not push too hard
while decoding the lock or you will bend
the tip of the
slide number three when removing the
tool from the lock go slowly and be
careful make sure the slide is centered
in the keyway before pulling out it''s
very easy to break the tip of the slide
if you are not
careful', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

Today we''re going to be making a
mechanical key for a 2010 Dodge Journey
using the Lei Pick CY24 for all Chrysler
a cut locks.
First thing we''re going to do is loop
our lock.
I like to use lock shot. If you don''t
have, you can use WD40.
Next thing we''re going to do, insert our
tool. I''ll pick in the make sure it''s
all the way to the shoulder.
I like to go the opposite way. So number
eight is not on top, it''s actually on
the bottom. So let''s start with the
eight cut. See how it bounces here?
That''s good. Let''s go over to seven.
Got a bounce on seven.
Bounce on six.
Bounce on five. Four is tight, so
release a little bit.
Four is bouncing now. Three is tight, so
release.
Got to bounce on three. And number two,
release. Now you have a bounce. So let''s
start working backwards.
Three
bounce is good. Four bounces is good.
Five is tight. So release a little bit.
It bounces now. So that''s good.
Number six is tight. Release a little
bit.
All right.
Now that''s picked. So let''s go ahead and
read. Make sure it''s all the way into
the shoulder so you get a proper
reading.
Number eight is a four.
Number seven is a three.
Number six is a one.
Five is a one.
Four is a three.
Number three is a three
and number two is a one. So, let''s see
if we uh decoded this properly. So,
we''ll go ahead and make a key. See how
we did.
All right. So, now that we cut a key,
let''s see if we decoded the lock
properly.
Works like butter.

hello everyone i''m chad from autel
diagnostics i''m the national sales
manager for strategic accounts
and we''re going to focus on the im508
in this training so the im 508 we''re
going to talk about the setup
we''re going to talk about how to do the
updates on the tool we''re going to talk
about getting scan reports
key programming some helpful resources
and
what is the key programmer and how do we
use it
so the im508 is based off of an
android tablet so the android tablet
does have diagnostics
and key programming built into the tool
we do have limited
app access to the device so autel really
limits
the apps that you can add onto this
android device
and we do that because there are so many
apps that will interfere with the maxi
im
software that we really wanted to limit
what was put onto the tool
we really recommend that you don''t put
any apps on the tool but there are some
basic apps that you can use if you want
some key programming resources apps
or something along those lines those can
be loaded if you want to
so you''ll see here on the screen we do
have two different parts that we''re
mainly going to focus on this is our key
programming device here on the left
and then we do have our android tablet
so right off we''re going to talk about
making sure that your tablet
is current and up to date and we want to
do this pretty much
every day just to make sure we always
have the latest and greatest software
when it comes to when it comes to
software
autel releases new updates almost every
week
and we want to make sure that you always
have the most
current and relevant software and autel
understands that
sometimes the the diagnostic software
that''s released is not perfect
and we want to know about that if
there''s an issue we want to know so we
can fix it
and then re-release it so those updates
are kind of come out
weekly so make sure that you check for
updates that are available
and we let you know that updates are
available by giving you a number
on top of that icon so if we look down
here in the bottom right corner
you''ll see settings and update and we
can see that in the
settings icon we have one update
available if we look at the updates icon
we have 24. so let''s go ahead and focus
on the settings one first
so if we go into settings you''re going
to see on the left hand side
that we have a firmware upgrade where
that number one icon is
so that firmware upgrade is going to be
able to upgrade
the background of the tool that''s going
to upgrade the android platform that''s
going to
upgrade the maxi im platform so all that
stuff is going to be done
in that firmware upgrade and to be able
to do that
we''ll just select that firmware upgrade
and you will see that
the update status shows up we do need to
be connected to wi-fi to be able to
retrieve these updates and see the
newest updates that are available
you can see here that currently this
tool is at version 1.5 and our latest
version
is 2.0 so quite a big jump when it comes
to firmware updates and then we just
select that update now button
and it will tell us that we need to
connect to the vehicle we need to
connect the obd2 cord
directly to the ob2 port and leave it
there while we do this update we do not
want to disconnect that
this update goes pretty fast it doesn''t
take a lot of time but
make sure we have a stable internet
connection and that we are connected to
the vehicle
at all times so once that''s done we''ll
just go back to the main screen
by pushing the back button that m here
the house in the middle of it
or we can use the back button down here
at the bottom you''ll notice with this
tool there''s always multiple ways to
navigate
so you can use whichever is most
convenient for you
if we go back to the maxi im screen and
we''ll focus on that update button the
update button shows us that we have
24 updates that are available now you
don''t have to do every update that is
available on these tools sometimes
you''ll get updates for vehicles that you
may not need
so it is totally up to you as far as
what updates you want to perform
we''re going to start out always with a
system update if a system update is
available
you must first do that system update
before you can do any vehicle line
updates and sometimes what we will see
is that that system update will hide
other updates that are available so you
may go in and say
oh the only update is a system update no
big deal i don''t want to do that right
now
but once you do that system update you
may have a bunch of vehicle updates
behind that
so i always recommend making sure that
you get those system updates done as
quickly as possible and you''ll notice
that we tell you what that system update
is on this particular
one we''re optimizing a payment function
that we''re going to talk about
here in a moment as well to be able to
do that update it''s a simple process
we just select that green down arrow and
that will start downloading
that update this speed is going to
depend on your internet connection
uh and some of these can be pretty large
files if you look over on the left hand
side
we tell you how large that file is so if
you''re working on a hotspot
do consider that as well once we get our
system updates done
it will go into the vehicle updates and
you can see that this one is showing a
volkswagen update
and if you look at the top of the screen
right here in the center you''ll notice
there''s two different sides of the tool
there''s the immobilizer side and the
diagnostics
side so each one is going to have their
own updates
for key programming or for diagnostics
right now
we''re under the diagnostics tab and you
can see that this volkswagen has an
update available
if we look here on the middle you can
see that it''s going to be a
basic snapshot of what this update is
and we''re going to support
all volkswagen models up to 2020 in this
update
but if you want more information because
a lot of times there''s a bunch of
information behind this
that will pull up more information about
this update so you can see all the
information in that update
and all the ins and outs of what has
been added
by just selecting that information icon
we''ll go back to the maxi im screen our
next one we''re going to focus on
is service so i talked about this being
based on the mx808 chassis from autel
and that
tool is a service tool so that gives us
the ability to do
oil life resets electronic parking brake
battery management resets
and more and this may be a function that
you would use every day but it is great
to have
if necessary especially the battery
management system
if a customer has replaced a battery in
that vehicle that you''re getting ready
to work on and they''ve
not redone that battery management
system or updated the battery management
this gives you the opportunity to do
that before you do
any key programming tasks so these
service functions are available for you
if you need them
if you see a need in the field
our next step we''re going to focus on is
the diagnostics
side of the tool and the diagnostics on
this tool are going to be
the ability to read and clear codes in
all modules
gather live data and do graphing there''s
no bi-directional controls in this tool
as far as diagnostics go
so let''s go ahead and jump in and see
what this looks like
when we go onto the diagnostic screen
you''re going to see all the different
manufacturers that you can select from
and you can break it down into u.s
european
and asian if you want to you''ll notice
that you have these
green down arrows on some of the
manufacturers
and that means that there''s an update
available so even before you go into a
manufacturer if you see that down arrow
on a chrysler you may want to do the
updates before performing diagnostics on
that vehicle so we can have
the latest and greatest software you''ll
notice that chrysler dodge and jeep are
all highlighted
and that''s because they''re all contained
into one download and we also have ford
ob2 that we can do updates on
whenever we were ready to go into a
vehicle if it is a 2006
or newer we can use auto vin that''s here
in the top left corner
what we''ll do is we''ll just select auto
and we''ll let the tool do all the hard
work
no need to select year make model the
tool will actually pull the vin
out of the vehicle and give us that vin
number off of the car here''s their vin
number
automatically pulled we''ll select ok and
that will tell us
the year make and model of the car so
this is a 2015
chevy volt and if we would scroll down
it would give us engine information
and all that there as well
so why why are we doing diagnostics why
are we giving you
diagnostics in a key programming tool
well
there''s a couple of key things that we
can use from this
diagnostic side of the tool and the
first one
is to keep yourself out of trouble if we
go to a vehicle
and even before we cut any keys or do
anything with this vehicle we can do
what''s called a pre-scan
and a pre-scanners gives us the ability
to scan this vehicle for codes
we can look through the vehicle and make
sure that there are no codes that
pertain to what we''re doing as far as
the key programming side of the tool
goes
so we can do a pre-scan we can get all
the code information
out of that vehicle first before we do
anything
as far as the keys going here''s why
emphasize that
because as a key programmer as a
locksmith
if you touch that vehicle everything
after that point
is your fault and
unfortunately in this industry people
say oh it wasn''t that way before you put
the keys in it
so this gives us the ability to cover
ourselves and
do that pre-scan report we can print
that report out and we can take that to
the service writer or the customer and
say hey mr customer just so you know
you have some other things going on here
that you may need to address before
i do this vehicle you have abs codes you
have airbot
module codes you have all these codes i
didn''t do those
i''m just letting you know that you have
them would you like me to proceed
they can sign off on that and you can go
about programming the keys to that
vehicle
we can also do a post scan a post scan
is scanning for codes
after you''re done programming keys so
did we have to take stuff apart did we
have to unplug
modules in the process did we set any
codes
in that vehicle this gives us the
ability to
scan that vehicle clear any codes out
that we created
and then go about finishing the key
programming process
and giving that customer the invoice so
we can read and clear codes in this
vehicle we can do
active tests and special functions under
that
service icon only none under the
diagnostic side so you see here just
some of the basic screens where we''re
talking about
the diagnostics and we''ll go through
those here in a moment
so let''s talk about what does it look
like so once we''ve auto vend that
vehicle we can select
diagnose and that will take us into our
option of auto scan or control unit
and you can go either way depending on
what you''re trying to do with the car if
we select control unit
that''s going to take us into every
module possible for that vehicle
so doesn''t mean it necessarily has that
module it just
could be in that car from the factory so
we may select
a module that this vehicle does not have
so if i was to select
electronic power seats in this vehicle
it would say no communication because
this car does not have that
but if you know exactly where you need
to go you can jump right into that
module and do what i call quick and
dirty
and jump right in and get the
information you need if we go back and
we select
auto scan what that''s going to do is
it''s going to go through
every module in that car it''s going to
talk to that module and say
are you here and do you have any codes
and it''s going to go through that
complete vehicle
and tell you any modules that have codes
now that we''ve done a complete auto scan
on this car you can see that the engine
control module does have
one code in it at the bottom of the
screen you''ll see a button that says
reports
this report icon gives us the ability to
see a
total health picture of that car so by
selecting report it will automatically
generate a report that shows all the
modules and any codes that are in those
modules
from there as well we''ll be able to
print that report to hand it to a
customer
if necessary or that we can keep it off
to the side and use that to put our
notes onto and i''ll show you how to
print here
at the end of the presentation so just
remember that that report icon is there
to make your life a little bit easier
especially if the vehicle has a lot of
codes in it
we can see all the codes in it and if
all those codes are pertaining to
what we''re doing in this key programming
session
if we want to go in and see exactly what
that code is in this engine control
module
we can select this little blue carrot
here on the right hand side of the tool
so if we select that it''s going to take
us into our options menu
for ecu information trouble codes and
live data
so ecu information that is going to be
the information about that module
what is the current calibration id what
is the vin number in that module and
that is important to you
because if a customer is swapping
let''s say a body control module on a
ford and
you were there to program keys back to
that vehicle did they program the vin
back to that module this gives us the
ability to make sure that our vins
match if we have any trouble in the key
programming session
we can also go to trouble codes and see
exactly what that trouble code is so if
we select trouble code
that''ll take us into any codes that are
in there this is going to give us
current pending or history or past codes
you can see on this particular car we
have a p0531 this is an ac refrigerant
pressure code
now this doesn''t pertain to our key
programming session but
if you wanted to know more about this
code this little icon here on the side
that looks like a snowflake that is
freeze frame data so that gives us
information about
what exact conditions were happening
when this code was set
if we select that it''s going to take us
into that data this is frozen data
so it''s not live this is information
that happened exactly when that code was
set and
what was going on during that session
so we can look at this and we can say
that this code was set
almost 1400 miles ago
so it is definitely not a current code
it''s something that happens
1400 miles ago so it''s not something we
have to focus on
right now to be able to do our
but we can also see some of the
statistics that were set during that
time so we know the engine was warmed up
it was 100 degrees
and some of the other information if we
focus down on those
now this is important to us in the key
programming session because if we have a
code for a
let''s say an antenna inside the car we
know how long that antenna''s been out
or if it''s continuing to go out if it''s
a current code if that antenna is
already
out or not been plugged back in it''s not
going to let us program keys
so we need to know that information
before we move forward so that''s where
we can find that
information we can also go into
live data and when we select live data
in that module you''ll see that this car
has an option for immobilizer data
and this is actually in the hybrid
control module on this chevy volt we''re
going to select
immobilizer and that will take us into
the live data of what the car is seeing
at this
moment so if we look at the live data
presented in this immobilizer module
you''ll see that we have immobilizer
environment
device what are those
well those are actually the antenna for
the proximity key
and if we look the value of those it
shows that those are
all okay if those are not okay
then we are going to have an issue with
an antenna and the key is not going to
program
how is it supposed to know if the key is
inside the vehicle or outside the
if an antenna is not working so we need
to make sure that those
are functioning as well and usually
those are going to set a code right away
so we can kind of break that down and
figure out which antenna has the issue
which one do they leave unplugged after
they took this whole vehicle apart and
put it back together
if we scroll down a little bit more
you''ll notice that we have the
immobilizer
system status so in this particular car
at this particular moment
i have the ignition off but i have the
accessories
on so you''ll see that showing that it is
currently in
standby mode so if we want to
go ahead and back out of this if we''re
all done
we can select that back arrow and that
will take us out so it''s going to ask us
are you done are you sure
you want to get out of here we''ll select
yes now to get completely out of this
vehicle we''re going to
select this icon up here at the top
where these two cars are then arrowed
down
and that is going to take us all the way
back to the beginning to the maxi im
screen and that is how you exit a
vehicle so if you are pretty deep into a
vehicle you don''t have to push that back
button 10 times
you can just push those cars with the
arrow pointing down
and that will take us all the way back
to the maxi im screen and out of
you cannot transition from diagnostics
to immobilizer
you have to back all the way out every
time to go from one side to the other
they are two completely different
softwares in the tool
so we have to make sure we back all the
way out and that car icon going down is
the easiest way to do that
so let''s talk about some of the hardware
in the tool and let''s talk about
specifically the key programmer this is
the
xp200 this comes in your im508 device
so there''s a couple different things
that this tool does it does a couple of
fancy things and a couple of not so
fancy things
and first is going to be to test and
identify keys and that''s what we''re
going to go through
it can perform ee prom functions so if
we have a vehicle that we need to access
that chip to be able to pull the pin
information out
we can do that from this tool and that
right here if you look on the side of
the tool there''s a little com port
there are boards that fit into the side
of that com port to give us the eeprom
access so we can actually remove chips
do in circuit out of circuit eeprom
functionality on a basic level
for our asian and domestic vehicles this
is where we can also do our pre-coding
of keys if our
vehicle that we''re working on does not
have a slot
in it for recognizing the keys no key
slot we can
perform the pre-code of the keys with
this tool as well
it may also be used as a security device
so anytime the tool asks you please plug
in programmer
we''re asking you to plug in that usb
cable into your programmer and it
actually just uses that as a secondary
authentication device for some of the
server
functionality that we''re doing so
just keep an eye on that if the tool
asks you for the programmer or plug in
the programmer
that''s what that means this process what
we''re going to do is we''re going to test
a key we''re going to make sure this key
is working and we''re going to make sure
that the key is functioning
so the first thing we''re going to do is
we''re going to select that programmer
icon
on the main screen whenever we do that
it''s going to take us to this screen is
automatically going to update this
programmer
every time we select programmer on the
icon it''s going to automatically do that
update so we''re always making sure that
we have
matching software in the tool and in the
once we''ve done that update you''re going
to see the option for
testing of keys to do chip
ee prom or just to get the version
information out of that tool
sometimes if you have to call tech
support they''ll ask you what the version
information is to make sure that you''re
on the current
update version to make sure we''re all
talking the same language and all
on the same page so currently what we
want to do is we just want to test a key
i want to test this key to see if it''s
even good it looks good
it looks pretty but isn''t any good we
can select
key and once we select key it''s going to
take us into
key read and write and key information
we''re going to start with
key read and write i just want to read
this key i want to know more about it
what kind of key is
it we have some keys that look exactly
the same and if you don''t know what the
fcc id
is you may not know what type of key
this is so we''ll select
key read and write we''ll stick that key
in that slot
and it will tell us pretty quickly what
kind of key this is
so this is a high tag 2 key okay that''s
that''s great to know but i need more i
need more information i need to know
what the key information is so we''ll
select ok
and then we''ll go to read key id i want
to know what the id
of this specific key is
so we''ll select read key id it''ll pull
that information out of the key and
there''s our key id now
there''s a couple different things that
we can use this key id for
because on some vehicles whenever we
look at them let''s say a toyota
it''ll tell us all the different key ids
in the key slots
and we can see okay i have a toyota key
and i have a key id
is it for this vehicle is it even
programmed to this vehicle
so we can go through we can compare the
key id that we have to the key ids that
are already programmed into the vehicle
so
we can use that for a couple of
different reasons or we can just make
sure that the key is actually
transmitting an id
and that the id is whole and there''s no
issues with that
so let''s go through an easy key
programming session we''re going to do a
key programming session on this
chevy volt and i know i know you don''t
have to have a tool
to do the key programming session on
chevy
but by golly it makes it easier and you
already got the tool so
let''s use it right so we can do this
chevy volt and i''m going to make it
present like an all keys lost and if you
have an all keys lost
on a proximity key car you can''t exactly
turn the ignition on
and if you can''t turn the ignition on
you can''t really do an automatic vin id
so if we''re doing all keys lost on this
car we''re going to manually select it so
we''re going to select
gm and we''re going to do a manual
selection
if you are way better at keys than i am
and you know exactly what kind of system
this is
you can do that you can select system
and go right in and jump right in and
start the key programming session
a lot of times i don''t know what these
systems are so i do manual selection
and manual selection means that we''re
going to actually manually id the car
and we''re going to let the tool do all
the hard work and all the hard thinking
so once we select manual selection we''re
chevy and it''s going to ask us where are
you
not where was the car built
because that can throw us way off where
are you
what area are you in so on this one i''m
in the good old u.s of a
so i''m going to select usa it''s going to
ask us what okay
what are you working on this is a chevy
volt so we''re going to select that and
then what year range and key
type so this one is a 2015 so we''re
going to select 2014 with 2016
smart our first step is to read the pin
in this vehicle we need to have a pin
on these chevy cars to be able to
program the keys to them
so we''re going to select read
immobilizer password and that is going
to get us the pin number
and we''re going to jump right into
password reading
is the ignition switch on no
because there''s no way to turn the
ignition switch on because i don''t have
a key
if we just go ahead and select okay
it''ll work us through this process it''s
going to ask
a couple of questions it''s going to read
the pin and bam there you go
there''s your pin number 1392. beautiful
part about this tool
is you don''t have to memorize that you
don''t have to write it down
if you want to you can take a screenshot
and usually i do
to take a screenshot if you look down
here at the bottom there''s a picture of
a scissors
on a box and that is how you take a
screenshot you just hold down
on that and it will click and it''ll
capture your screen
and it''ll save that into data manager on
your tool so
if you''re like me and sometimes you get
distracted and you''re going a bunch of
different directions
you can grab the screenshot so you don''t
have to write down what the pin number
is but
do remember that the tool will store
your pin number for that session
so it''ll automatically fill that later
on
we''ll select ok and now it''ll take us
back to our
main function menu we''ll select keyless
system and this is a controller
area network for can network so we''ll
select keyless system
and then we want to let''s say we want to
know more about this car okay
how many keys are programmed to this car
how uh
how is this system set up we can find
that a couple different ways so if we
select
information that will take us into
information about this immobilizer
module and
data about it so we can see how many
keys are already programmed into this
car
we can see the vin number that is
programmed to this module and does it
match the
vin number that is in every other module
in this car
we can also see some calibration ids
vcmc
lots of information is going to be there
if you need it
if you just want to know how many keys
are there you can select number of smart
keys so we give you a lot of different
options when it comes to
getting information out of these
vehicles so in this one we''re going to
all smart keys lost
and it''s going to tell us what the next
step is so the next step is we need to
place a smart key
to be learned into the key slot and
we''re going to give you some information
about where
that key slot possibly could be once you
push
ok it''s going to oh look automatically
populate that pin directly into the tool
you didn''t have to remember it didn''t
have to write it down you didn''t have to
write it on your arm with all the other
pin numbers you got going on
so a tool automatically saves that for
and now we go through a couple of
different steps we''re going to follow
the directions of the
of the tool so it''s going to configure
the system first
it''s going to go through that 12 minute
wait and then it''s going to tell you
what to do turn the key on ignition off
push this button twist that knob
turn the flashers on all that
information of how to is going to be
built into the tool so you don''t have to
memorize that for every vehicle
it''s going to tell you exactly what to
do right there on the tool
once it''s all done it''s going to tell
you that the current key is complete and
the matching is done
do you want to do another one yes or no
on this one
we can do two keys i can push yes and
it''ll automatically go through that
process
and no more wait time so that was on a
chevy car and chevy''s
they''re pretty darn easy but i wanted to
show you the process
of how the tool takes you through that
step by step
so you can see exactly how that process
is going to happen but not every vehicle
is the same
so let''s check out a toyota and see what
kind of information we can get
out of that vehicle so i have selected
on this one if you look down in the
bottom it says
toyota camry and i selected a smart key
one of the things that i love about this
tool and that can really help you
through this process
is looking for a button that says
relevant information
so whenever we select this relevant
information button
the autel tool is going to give you some
good data and some good information
we''re going to tell you what the chip
number is in this car
we''re going to talk about the key
frequency which is 315 and we''re gonna
talk about what
type of key it is and i know a lot of
times you''re going to know that
but sometimes there''s options on the
tool
that we''re not for sure which one to
and by selecting the relevant
information it''s going to tell us hey
if you select this one you''re selecting
a 128 bit h
key it''s a 315 frequency it''s a
proximity key and oh by the way this is
what the key looks like is this what you
want to do
if it''s not that''s not my key we can
back out of that and select
the other option so good information and
that relevant information
uh to be had so make sure you use that
whenever you''re not sure about what
direction to go next
that will help guide you in that
step-by-step process
as we get into this vehicle a little bit
farther
you''re going to see a button down here
in the bottom that says operate
guide and operate guide is going to give
us a lot of information
so we look on the main screen and it
says add smart key clear smart key
smart box reset learn ecu
synchronization backup of mobile
data and generate simulator key
what i i''ve never done a toyota before i
have no idea
what any of those mean well if we select
operate guide it''s going to take us to a
hey
just so you know add smart key means
this function
serves to add a smart key if you want to
do a smart box reset
we''re actually going to clear all the
information out of that smart box
and what is a generate simulator key
well this function
serves to use the apb112
to generate a key so we''re going to tell
you definitions of all those things that
are on the previous screen
that you were just looking at but also
there are precautions
because if you don''t tow toyota right
it can cause you some problems so we''re
going to give you precautions we''re also
going to give you step by steps hey
this is all the process we''re going to
do through this vehicle are you
ready or do you have everything you need
so precautions on this specific
toyota if you add a smart key function
as execute estep must be completed
within a specific time
don''t go grab a sandwich and come back
because it''ll it''ll wipe everything out
so there is time limits on this vehicle
what does it mean to synchronize the id
what does it mean to use
a generate simulator key and what are we
going to do with this eeprom data
so it''s going to give us precautions
about this vehicle even before we do it
so if you''re new to a vehicle
look for that operate guide because it''s
going to give you a lot of information
about your next step
and what you''re going to do in this
process so let''s contrast that with
let''s say a volkswagen because every
manufacturer does it different
if you thought that every manufacturer
is exactly the same you''ve not been
doing this very long
so every manufacturer is going to be
different so this
is uh volkswagen audi key programming
when we jump into a volkswagen audi car
there''s smart mode manual mode expert
mode and advanced mode
so advanced mode is where we are going
to see
our mqb immobilizer 4
and mo4 and mqb
now these are the only functions in the
tool that are going to have a
pay-per-use
subscription fee uh the immobilizer in
four is ten dollars and mqb is 30 bucks
and these are all done via paypal
and it''s not a per programming fee so if
you have an issue you have to pay for it
again it''s not like a token don''t think
of it that way
as long as you''re in that vehicle and
you''ve already done your your one
payment via paypal
you can do that as many times you need
to be able to get this vehicle figured
out so
that is the only pay use in this tool
everything else is going to be unlimited
use as long as your tool is under update
contract
so that is the only time you would have
any pay functionality and that
again is done via paypal directly from
the tool quick and easy process you
don''t need to buy any tokens or have any
tokens
on hand
so if we go back to the volkswagen main
page we can jump
into expert mode if we jump into expert
mode
it''s going to give us a lot of
the different types of systems anytime
this is covered up a little bit but
anytime you see dump
in the description that means you''re
going to do an eeprom pull module out
so different styles of volkswagen
systems are all here in expert mode and
we named it expert mode because you know
exactly what you''re jumping into if
you''re not a volkswagen expert
you can go back and click smart mode and
let the tool do all the help
for you but i guess what i''m getting at
is the tool is very proficient when it
comes to volkswagen
it can do a lot of the volkswagen
information and the tool will actually
walk you through that process to do it
if a module is required to pull out it
will
show you what that module looks like and
it will tell you where that module is
located it will tell you if you have to
pin out all that module or do any
connections to that module
all that''s going to be built directly
into the tool
getting information from the tool to a
printer
can also be very helpful we talked about
the the pre-scan postscan reports we
talked about printing reports but how
does that process
work so if you have a printer in your
shop or if you have a printer in your
van we''re going to go through the
process to
set up that printer and what it looks
like to be able to use that printer
so the alltel printer setup is where we
can do our pre-scan post scans we can
actually print screen captures
uh remember what i was talking about
where you writing all your notes on the
palm of your hand or on your arm
we don''t need to do that anymore we can
capture those and print those out
wirelessly it makes it such an easier
so to do this process you''re going to
need a pc
and the tool will actually communicate
directly to that pc so if you have a pc
in your shop or in your van
and you leave that on in your tool and
that piece here on the same network
we can communicate from the tool to the
pc to the printer
and the reason we did that is because we
don''t know all the printer drivers
and some printer drivers are not
compatible with an android tablet
so this gives us the ability to just
send it directly to a pc let the pc
interpret all those drivers and just
spit out the printer so what we''re going
to do from our pc we''re going to
auteltools.com support and downloads
and you''re going to see this download
for maxi pc suite
we''ll download that pc suite onto
our pc and that will put a folder
onto our start menu
so we go in and select that start menu
and go to the autel folder it''s going to
give us a drop down
and you''re going to see pc link
now once you click pc link a whole lot
of nothing is going to happen
well a lot of nothing that you see
actually what that''s going to do is
going to take that
and throw that printer icon down into
your status bar in the bottom right hand
corner of your windows pc
so you''ll see if you go down that this
little printer icon is hanging out down
there and what that means is
i''m ready i''m ready to receive your
print
um and it''s always ready to go
if you don''t have that on it will not it
will not do anything so make sure that
printer icon automatically turns on
when your pc turns on so what is that
going to do it''s actually going to send
a version of a pdf directly from your
im508
to your pc and that is going to show up
in your pc link if you select to auto
print it will automatically come out
your printer
if you select or if you deselect auto
print it''ll actually come to your pc
in a pdf document that you can that you
can save
to your pc uh for later on use
so a lot of information a lot of
information about your im508
and i know i didn''t get deep into the
key programming session
because the tool is actually going to
take you through that process
and every manufacturer is going to be
different so i recommend
just trying it go ahead and push some
buttons read that relevant information
look at that operate guide to get the
most information out of that tool
to know exactly what your next step is
so there are some accessories to the
im508 as well and the one that we talked
about the most
is the apb-112 and that''s going to be
used for toyota
doing a key simulator i would recommend
as the main accessory that you would add
to this im508
so again thanks for joining me i
appreciate you for coming

the IM 508 features the basic
Diagnostics you would expect from an
auto tell MX 808 plus all your key
programming and immobilizer
functionality this tool is perfect for
your Asian and domestic vehicles and
covers the majority of the vehicles to
program keys for high security and
immobilizer reset the IM 608 as all
those capabilities plus european cars to
do in circuit and out of circuit
programming let''s go through the
features of the IM 508 n 608 to show you
how they work the IM 508 has your basic
diagnostic functions being able to read
and clear codes in all modules live data
and graphing it has all the service
functions that autel is known for in the
service to be able to do oil life reset
electronic parking brakes DPF region and
so much more but here''s where the magic
happens inside the immobilizer
functionality is where we''re able to
program and relearn keys and all keys
lost to your Asian and domestic vehicles
85% of this is done through the obd2
port making it even more simple for you
to use the tool the IM 608 is based on
the MS 908 s chassis giving you the
ability to do all the active tests
special functions coding initialization
and memory relearn''s autel is known for
you will notice on the main screen we
have two new icons the immobilizer icon
and the programmer icon when we go into
the immobilizer screen you will notice
all the vehicles that we can do key
learning on when I say key learning that
means adding keys removing keys even
doing all keys lost the programming is
done via the obd2 port
just like on the IM 508 on 85% of
vehicles in North America making the
process even more simple for you to add
keys and remove keys to vehicles Auto
understands that adding keys and taking
keys away may be a daunting task so with
this process we have added all the step
by step features that you need to know
to be able
program keys to your vehicle in this
example we''re going to use a Chevy Volt
so if I go into GM I can auto VIN the
car
and automatically pull up the vehicle
information you will notice on these
vehicles were able to pull the pin
directly from the vehicle to be able to
relearn keys and yes that includes
Chrysler pins on this one we''re going to
read the immobilizer password and then
we have password reading to go to the
next step
by reading the password the tool will
store that password to be able to
relearn your keys from the diagnostic
tool we''ll be able to see number of keys
add smart keys and all keys lost this
gives us the ability that even if you''re
missing all keys for your vehicle this
tool will be able to force on the
ignition and relearn new keys to your
car you''ll also notice that the tool
provides information on each vehicle
this information includes the key type
how many number of keys the vehicle
currently has and what style of key and
what the key looks like this really
narrows down the process when
programming keys all the relevant
information is going to be based on the
tool simply follow the directions go
step by step and a tool will walk you
through the process the magic of the I M
tools is in the key programmer the IM
508 comes with an 8 p 200 this is where
we place the key to read write and learn
keys to the vehicle on the I M 508 it
comes with an XP 400 this tool allows us
to do infrared keys on Mercedes IC keys
on some of the new Hyundai Kia''s and be
able to do a EEPROM functions on
European vehicles the I M 608 also comes
with a J 2534 flash programming device

In this video, I will show how to
program Dodge Charger key fob. Easy
method. Begin with two working keys and
the new fob in hand. Then sit in the
driver''s seat and close all doors.
Insert the working key and cycle the
ignition three times without starting.
Then remove the key and quickly press
any button on the new fob until the
locks cycle. If needed, repeat the cycle
once more to confirm programming is
complete.
Start by inserting the working key and
cycling the ignition three times, ending
with the key in the off position and
door is closed. Press any button on the
new fob until you hear the door lock
cycle. That indicates the fob learned
successfully. If locks do not cycle,
repeat the ignition cycle and press the
fob again. Finish by testing lock,
unlock, trunk, and panic to confirm
every feature works as expected with the
new fob. If the new fob fails to
program, first replace its battery and
try the sequence again while keeping all
doors closed. Double check that the dome
light is off and that you use the
working key correctly when cycling the
ignition. If problems persist, verify
compatibility with your charger model
and consider trying another known
working key or consulting a locksmith to
avoid unnecessary dealer fees and ensure
proper security features remain intact.

differs between JK and JL models. For JK
models from 2007 to 2018, it''s a manual
process using ignition cycling and
button presses. For JK models, turn the
ignition from off to on and back to off
within 5 to 10 seconds to enter
programming mode. Then press the fob
buttons. JL models, especially with UK
Connectnect 4 or 5, use the Jeep Wave
smartphone app for remote pairing via
Bluetooth. Download the app, link your
VIN, and scan the FOB''s QR code. The key
difference is app integration for JL
owners, offering a modern approach. For
both models, ensure your FOB battery is
fresh and there''s no signal
interference. JK owners can use
aftermarket programmable fobs for newer
features. Common issues include dead
batteries and software glitches,
especially in JL models with UK
Connectnect. If you encounter pairing
loops, a dealer software flash might be
necessary. Always check your Jeep''s
manual for model specific instructions.
Statistics show that DIY programming
success rates are higher for JK models
at 78% compared to JL models at 65% due
to app complexities. Consider
professional programming for JL models
to avoid potential BCM corruption. For
JK models, ensure all FOBs are present
during programming as they all need to
be programmed at once.
Looking ahead, the trend is towards
digital key management. Expect increased
app-based pairing and potentially
AIdriven keyless entry in future
Wranglers. While traditional FOBs may
decline, cyber security remains a
concern, prompting Jeep to prioritize
encrypted pairing protocols.', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

&gt;&gt; In this video, I will show how to
program Jeep Wrangler key fob step by
step. Start by sitting comfortably in
the driver''s seat with every door closed
and both the key fob and vehicle key
within reach. Keep other key fobs away.
Turn the ignition on and off following
the sequence I demonstrate. Press the
fob buttons as instructed and listen for
the confirmation chime to verify
successful programming. Follow mystep
paste instructions and watch or listen
for vehicle confirmation cues. This
makes programming less stressful and
more predictable. Cycle the ignition
exactly as described. Then press
specific fob buttons when I tell you.
Timing matters. If your vehicle responds
with a chime or lock flash, that means
success. Repeat the process for
additional fobs. And if something fails,
reset by leaving the vehicle and
starting again from the beginning. If

video. If programming does not work, try
simple fixes before calling a dealer.
These often save time and money. Replace
the fob battery first, then retry the
sequence while holding the fob near the
steering column. Be patient and follow
exact timing. Small deviations can cause
failure. If issues persist, consult the
vehicle owner manual for model specific
notes or consider professional help for
stubborn key fobs that resist

infinity vehicle or maybe you have a
regular key and need a new one of those
for your nissan or infinity vehicle well
i''m mike i want to show you how you can
use this simple key programming kit
available from tomsky.com to program new
fob or new key for your nissan and
infinity vehicles in only 15 minutes
let''s take a look once you''ve ordered
this simple key programming kit from our
website tomsky.com it''ll arrive in the
mail in just a few days
in the box
it comes the user guide for the simple
key programmer there''s some important
instructions here like making sure your
vehicle battery is good and charged turn
off your headlights your air
conditioning your heater your radio any
lights that are going to be drawing the
battery you don''t want the battery to
drain while you''re doing the programming
process
all right there''s two steps to
programming your fob any fobs that came
in the box are going to require an
activation step
many times if you order additional fobs
that come separately they may not
require the activation step so let me
first show you how to go through the
activation you find your vehicle this
lookup table today we''re doing a nissan
altima 2015
and we have the four button remote with
trunk
so
we need code 42.
the instructions will walk you through
everything you need to do the first step
is to press the top and the bottom
button at the same time
and you''ll see a blue light that turns
on solid if you got a blue light like
that you know you need to go through
activation
now if you wait too long before entering
the code it''ll time out and you have to
start over so be aware that many times
in this programming process steps are
time sensitive
let''s get it ready to activate okay
lights on solid we''ll use the top button
to enter the number four we''ll use the
second button to enter two
one
two
three
four
now that we''ve completed that we push
the bottom button on the fob
for about two seconds till it begins
flashing back the code
okay one two three four pause
one two okay we entered the code four
two so it''s been activated
we''ve entered the code four two
successfully so this is now activated
for 2015 nissan altima
now there''s a few things you should be
aware of with this
simple key
programmer first it has a
tamper evidence seal so once you use
this on your vehicle it will pair to the
vin on your vehicle now you can program
up to four keys or four fobs for nissan
and ultimate vehicles with this
programmer so that can be helpful just
know you won''t be able to use it on a
different vehicle next
in this programming procedure the
instructions tell us to turn it to dial
position number seven
there we got it on 7.
now with the vehicle turned off the
engine not running come down we''ve got
to find the obd2 port it''s down near the
breaking gas pedal in this case we find
it right there we''re going to plug the
programmer in we''ll we''ll hear it beep
as it plugs in
now there''s some instructions that''ll
help walk you through these steps hold
to confirm means to press the button for
about two seconds
so we''ve got our one working key fob uh
notice this is the one with the tile key
finder if you don''t have one of those
you might want to pick it up on our
website it''ll pair to your smartphone to
help you always know where your keys are
at
in case you lose them at the park or
they''re lost in your house
okay let''s go through this
it says
hold to confirm here we go
i''m gonna open the door
and close the door
and i''m going to turn the hazard lights
on
press to continue
it warns us do not press the brake
during the programming process
it''s communicating with the vehicle
press and hold the start button until
the dash lights turn on
so i''m pressing and holding the start
button
dash light is turned on i let go
and we press to continue
it''s communicating with the vehicle turn
the ignition off
all right press start with the remote
the security light will blink
okay i''m going to press
and release
now the security light''s flashing on the
dashboard you see that right there
flashed five times
this key is now paired again we''re going
to
all right turn the ignition off
ignition''s off
all right do we want to pair another key
why yes yes we do we need to pair the
new one now
so press to continue or you press you
click you click once to end but we need
to hold it down to pair another key so
let''s hold it down for a couple seconds
okay pick up the next key we got the
next key
this is the new one we''re programming
that we activated
press start with the remote the security
light will blink here it is we''re going
to watch for the security light to blink
i''m pressing
start but i''m not holding it down
one two three four five sorry it was
blurry there
but you saw the security light blink
we''re going to press to continue
turn the ignition off
the ignition is now off
pair another key hold the pair press end
we''re not doing any more key fobs today
so i''m just going to make a quick click
to end
to exit pairings press press start with
paired remote i''m going to press start
press and release the dashboard lights
all turned on
start to turn the ignition off turn the
vehicle off
key registration complete
okay unplug the
installer
okay i''ve moved the key fobs away from
my vehicle i''m gonna try and start it
now
[Music]
and it tells me it can''t detect a key
okay i''ve got my original one let''s make
sure it works
okay vehicle turned on just fine
now i''ve got the new one let''s try
starting the vehicle with it
and voila
there we have it
both key fobs lock and unlock the doors
and start the vehicle
after you''ve completed programming don''t
forget to cut the emergency keyblade to
avoid the hassle of finding a car
dealership or locksmith to cut the key
you can order our optional key by photos
key cutting service
if you complete programming and you find
that none of your key fobs are working
don''t fare
the frequent last question tells you
what to do
programming nissan key fob starts
by racing all fobs now sometimes it goes
wrong and you find you''ll have no
working fobs but take a deep breath and
don''t panic there''s an easy fix to get
the original key fob working again lets
you know right here that you have to go
through this procedure it depends if you
got stuck at step 13 or step 14. in our
case finish step 14
and so it tells us to hold the original
key
on the start button
for 15 seconds and go through that whole
procedure notice how this light is
flashing when pressed
so that tells us that it''s still in
pairing mode release the start button
with the original key and then i''m going
to hold it there for about 15 seconds
and then i''m going to repeat this three
times
now watch for that security light
all right you''re going to wait 15
seconds
turned
off notice this key registration
complete this key i''ll start the vehicle
again
there we go and we can start over at
step one in the programming process the
trick is getting that security light
to turn on and blink five times
one other item i want to warn about in a
very rare but easy to fix situation
there are some push to start nissan
vehicles that have a fuse titled push
button start
if this fuse had been removed
or was burnt out before programming
begins your vehicle may seem like it
stops working the dashboard lights will
not illuminate
around the push button start there are
some letters the lock acc and on buttons
will not be illuminated to fix this you
simply replace this fuse to get your
original key fob working again and then
you can continue programming
now we also offer a full money back
guarantee so if you try this and it just
doesn''t work for your vehicle
simply email help tomsky.com and we''ll
provide a full refund when you send
everything back with the original
packaging that''s it that''s just how easy
it is to use this simple key programming
kit from tomsky.com
to make yourself a new fob for your
nissan and infinity vehicles please
visit our website we''ve got lots of
different kits available as i said at
the beginning we also have vehicles that
program keys for regular turnkey start
vehicles like this
in addition to these smart fobs finally
don''t forget to pick up one of these
tile key finders to help make sure your
keys
can always be found if they get lost now

lowest cost way that you can make a
spare key for your Chevy vehicle. Before
we get started, I''m gonna call the Chevy
dealership and find out how much they
want to rip me off for to make another
key like this. Here we go. I might be on
hold for a while. We''ll come back to
this call later to show you just how
much money you can save. Check out how
easy this is. We''re going to make two
new keys. I''ve labeled these both with a
purple and a blue tag just to keep them
separate. These are both a quality
aftermarket. Uh, this is the original
OEM key with the Chevy logo. We''ll be
using this programming tool. As long as
you can use a smartphone, you should be
able to program a spare key for your
vehicle. It''s important to know you must
have at least one working key that
allows you to start the engine and drive
the vehicle in order to use Tom''s Key
Company do-it-yourself programming
solutions to make a second or a third
key. In today''s video, we''ll end up with
a total of three keys when we''re done.
So, we we try to make it super easy.
We''re going to start by scanning the QR
code. Opens up and you got to go get
your app. Okay, with the app downloaded,
I''m going to fire it up and we need to
come in. We''re going to pair a new key.
So, first we got to find the OBD port
and insert the programming device into
it. The location of the OBD port can
vary by vehicle. Sometimes it''s up here
under a panel. Often it''s down near the
gas and brake pedal. Go ahead and plug
it in. Now, to make your life a little
bit easier so you can see what''s
happening, I recommend picking up this
optional extension cable. Okay, we''re
going to plug in the programmer. We see
it''s got power. We need to get the
Bluetooth connection made. Okay, we''re
going to press to scan.
We should see the matching serial number
and we can make a connection to the
device. Here we go. Our programmer is
now connected. And let''s continue. I
want to point out today we''re working on
a push button start vehicle, not a
turnkey ignition. So, this one has a
smart fob. We do have solutions for lots
of different types of keys and vehicles.
So, check our website. I also want to
point out there''s great technical
support. If you want to have someone to
help you out if you run to issues, just
know that they''re available Monday
through Friday, daytime hours. All
right, let''s begin programming.
First, we need to enter the license
plate or scan the VIN. This is helping
us identify the proper year making
model. Okay, I''ve entered the license
plate. We''re in check plate.
Should pull up a 2020 Silverado. It
didn''t fully get it, so it''s not
perfect. 2020. Here we go. Let''s
continue. All right. What kind of key?
We have the smart key system. All right.
There''s some important information. Uh
programming should take no more than 15
minutes. If it''s running more than that,
you can call tech support right down
here. Don''t navigate out of the app
during programming. And make sure you''ve
got all previously programmed keys
present. So, you''ve got to have one
working key. That''s the one we''ve got
right here. This key, we have no other
working keys. So, just this one plus the
two that we''re going to be programming.
Okay. Let''s go ahead and start
programming. Please wait. You got to
have a solid internet connection on your
phone to do this. While this is counting
up, let me point out a couple important
things. The programming slot may be in
different spots, like in here, down
there in the cup holder, or around the
start button. The app or your owner''s
manual will tell you. About 62%.
Be back in a moment. H looks like my
call to the car dealership is still on
hold. All right, we''re just about there.
And here comes 100. All right, preparing
the dongle for programming. Saw my
Bluetooth light turn out. It''s getting
ready. Bluetooth light turned back on.
Okay, leave the ignition off and turn
the hazard lights on. So, engine is not
running. My doors are shut.
Just turned on my hazard lights. They''re
blinking. Okay, we''ll go ahead and click
continue.
Configuring the system. Please wait.
Hazard lights stop blinking.
tells me a pin code 8624. Okay, jot that
pin code down in case you need to
manually enter it later. Configuring the
system. Please wait 45 seconds. The
ignition was dark. It just turned back.
It just lit back up. So, it''s very
normal in programming. There may be some
different things that happen up on the
dashboard.
In fact, most Chevys will tell us it''s
ready for the next remote when it''s time
to program a new key or new remote. All
right. put the new keyless remote into
the programming slot area. It''s located
either in the center console, view the
owner''s manual. I''m going to take my
other two remotes. I''m going to set them
far away and put this this new one with
a blue tag right down here in the cup
holder. The key in the programming slot.
We can hit continue.
Okay,
dashboard just lit up. All sorts of
stuff going on up here. There''s a
security light on. Verifying the PIN
code. Please wait. Give it a 10-minute
wait uh for the security system wait
timer. Let me point out a few important
things before you start. Make sure you
turn off the HVAC. Leave the radio off.
Be sure your headlights are off. Don''t
have the light in the car on. You don''t
want to drain your vehicle battery
during this programming process. Power
button has a green light and emergencies
continue to flash. This is really
important because if your vehicle
battery ever dies or the fob battery
dies, you''re not going to be able to get
in unless you have the emergency
keyblade cut. And we have this awesome
key by photo technology. You simply add
the key by photo service to your order
and then you''ll upload photos of your
existing key and we will cut your new
key so it arrives already fitting your
vehicle. Now you might ask, what if
something goes wrong? I''ve already
pointed out there''s a phone number you
can call where where you''ll get a real
person who will talk you through
problems that you run into while
programming. We also have lots of
answers to common questions. Visit
help.tomskey.com.
And if for whatever reason we can''t get
the problem solved and your spare key
just won''t work, send it all back to us.
You get a full refund. We''re about
twothirds of the way through. Let''s
check on that car dealership. See how
we''re doing on hold.
This is Todd.
Hey Todd, I''m trying to find out what it
costs for another key fob for a 2020
Chevy Silverado.
This is just for the key in the
transmitter. You''re at uh with tax
you''re at 33130.
33130 with tax. Okay.
Mhm. and I can get you out to service
and they can let you know how much it is
for the programming.
It sounds good. Do you ever have any of
those keys people buy online? Do you
know if those work or not? I''ve seen
some for a lot less. But
yeah, I don''t I don''t know how well they
work. I know that I can''t cut them on my
machine because they''re a lot softer and
they they come on my machine and then it
it breaks our bits. So
Okay. Okay.
So I know I''m not able to cut them on
our machine. Um, but let me get you out
to service and they''ll give you an idea
on programming. Hold on.
Awesome. Okay. Thank you.
Can''t cut it on his machine. Whatever.
Did you hear that? 331 just for the key
fob and cutting. Back on hold. All
right. I''m 6 minutes into the phone call
just to find out how much they want to
charge. We learned it''s $330 just for
the key fob. Now, we got to find out
about programming. All right, we''re just
about done. I noticed the security light
has turned off. That''s a good sign.
There we go. We finished our 10-minute
wait. Configuring the system. Please
wait.
Okay. Up here, we see ready for remote
number three. So, that means there''s one
remote that''s been lost somewhere in the
world. We can program up to the maximum
number the vehicle is allowed, which So,
I''m going to click the start button one
time.
And now I''m going to wait up here.
There. See that? It says ready for
remote number four. Okay. Continue.
Configuring system. Please wait. We''re
getting some flashes. It says that
driver 3 on memory features. Do we have
additional new keys we want to program
the vehicle? Why yes, yes, we do. Put
the next keyless remote into the
programming area. Pull out the blue key.
Put in the key with the purple tag on
the dashboard.
I see it says it''s ready for remote
number four. Okay, we''ll go ahead and
hit continue.
Please wait. All right, we''re going to
do the same thing.
Do
we have any additional keys? Okay, we''re
going to say no. We''ve just finished
programming all the keys we need for
this vehicle. Configuring the system.
Please wait. The dashboard''s turned on.
Click the start button once to turn the
ignition off. Yep, my dashboard''s turned
on. Click once. Turn off.
Turned off down there. Press and hold
the vehicle start button for 15 seconds,
then click continue. So, let''s do this.
1 2 3 4 12 13 14 15. Okay, let go. The
ready for remote message should be no
longer be displayed on the dash. If the
message has not gone away, press and
hold the start button for another 12 to
15 seconds. So, let''s see. That ready
for remote is gone. What will happen if
the vehicle is not fully ended
programming? If it still said ready for
mode on the dash, this is a really
important point to follow because
otherwise what happens is you''ll try to
start the engine and it''s stuck in
programming mode. So, you don''t want
that. If it does get stuck in
programming mode, there''s a real simple
fix. I can link to another video or help
section will have info on it, but all
you have to do is disconnect the
battery, the vehicle battery, and it''ll
help reset the computer. All right,
let''s hit continue. Do not press the
brake pedal. Hold the start button for 6
to 10 seconds until the dash is fully
turned on. So, here we go.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7. There. See that? So, it
can fake you out. At first, a few lights
will turn on. You want to hold it on
till all the lights are on the
dashboard. Again, an important point to
make sure you fully exit programming
mode. I''m going to hit continue.
Press the start button for two seconds
to turn the ignition off. Okay, here we
go. One, two.
Hit and continue.
Open and close the driver door once.
Opening the driver door. Closing the
driver door. Vehicle beeped at me.
Hit continue.
Configuring the system. Please wait for
about 30 seconds. Okay, be back in a
moment. All right, here we go. Hold the
brake pedal and push the start button to
start the engine.
Boom. The truck fired up. Look at that.
Engine''s running. Okay, with the engine
running, let''s hit continue. Click the
start button to turn the engine off. Hit
continue. Configuring the system. Please
Sooner or later, we''ll get done with
this. Open and close the driver door
once. Here we go. Open the door. Close
the door.
Okay, let''s hit continue.
Press the lock button and the unlock
button on the new remote. Listen for the
locks to click. Okay, I''m pulling out
the purple. I just pulled out the purple
lock.
Hit lock.
Heard them click. Hit unlock.
Okay, let''s go ahead and hit continue.
If you heard the locks click, then click
continue. If the locks did not respond
the new remote, make sure it has no
battery. If the remote still doesn''t
work, lock unlock the doors. You may
have an incorrect part number. Please
continue and complete program procedure
anyway to vehicle computer gets back to
normal mode. Okay, we heard the lock and
unlock click. So, let''s hit continue.
Success. Configuring the system. Please
wait. Current number of program keys,
four. All right, this is good. Now, it
says four keys. Remember, we have our
one original key here. Program the blue
one, program the purple one, and then
when the vehicle was manufactured, there
was a fourth key. Well, it was really
the second key way back then. That''s
lost somewhere in the world. So that''s
why it says total number of four when I
only have three. Continue. Programming
successful. Please exit programming and
test your new keyless remote. Click
complete. System is restarting. Okay.
Program successfully completed. All
right. We can leave feedback. Before we
do that, we''re going to unplug our
programming tool. All right. Let''s make
sure our keys work. Unlock. Boom.
Unlocks the vehicle. Locked it. Let''s do
the purple one now. Lock. Unlock. Look
at that. We''ll check the original key.
Make sure it''s still working as well.
Look at that. These keys are all locking
and unlocking the door. But there''s
still something really important we want
to check. We want to be sure that each
of these is actually programmed to start
the engine. I''m going to turn off my
emergency flashers. I''m going to set the
three keys outside the vehicle far
enough away that the vehicle can''t
start.
Okay. To find out if they''re far enough
away, I''m going to push this. Try and
start the engine. Nothing''s happening.
Look at that. What do we got? No remote
detected. So, that''s good. That means we
can now bring each remote back in one at
a time.
So, I''m going to test all three of my
remotes. So, here''s the original one.
Boom. Engine fires up. That''s a good
thing. Tells me for this vehicle. That''s
driver number two. Memory features.
Turn it off. Let''s go get the next
remote. Take this one out of the
vehicle.
Okay, here''s one of the new ones. Blue
one. Let''s start the engine.
Boom. Look at that. Fired right up.
Tells us that''s driver number three for
memory features. Okay, same procedure.
Turn off the engine. Get this out of the
We''re back with the final one. Purple.
Let''s try starting the engine. Press the
brake.
Excellent. Engine fires up. Well, we''ve
tested it. Let''s leave some feedback.
Yes, everything is working great. Do we
need any help from the technical support
team? I don''t think so.
Okay, there we go. We''re done. Okay, I
also want to check I''m going to try
remote start. No, let me jump out. Lock
the vehicle.
Boom. Excellent. Fired up. Okay, now for
the tailgate.
Here we go. Beautiful.
Let me close it.
Let''s make sure our passive entry works.
There we go. Excellent. Boom. Can you
believe how easy that was? I got two new
spare key fobs in about 10 minutes for
this truck. Now, you might ask yourself,
what if you run into a problem? You may
never have programmed a car key before.
Well, guess what? It''s pretty easy, but
we know that issues can arise. So, we''ve
got support. You can call on the phone
or visit our website, help.tomskey.com,

of Tom''s Key Company. I''m still on hold
with the Chevy dealership. Let''s find
out what they''re going to rip me off for
and how long it''s going to take. I''m
trying to find out what it costs to
program a new key fob. The parts guys
transferred me over to you.
Uh, yeah. Programming on a key fob. Is
it going to run you $180?
180 bucks. Okay.
331 plus 180. Yep. You''re at 511.
511. Okay. And how long should I plan to
be there for for it? Um, I plan an hour
or two.
An hour or two? Okay,
sounds good.
Got to cut the key and then once they''re
done with it, we can go start
programming it.
Okay, cool. Do you know if there any
place I mean that''s really expensive,
right? Like 500 bucks for a key. Do you
know if there any other ways to get get
them cheaper?
Um, they
may or may not work and we don''t know
until we try to program it. So, we would
charge you 180 whether it took or not.
Got it. Okay. cuz we got to go through
and do the process and I got to pay my
check the first time and we don''t know
until it comes back and works or comes
back and doesn''t work.
Can you believe that? $511 to make a
spare key fob for this Chevy Silverado
and they said it''s going to take an hour
or two sitting in their waiting room.
Well, they do it. They weren''t sure if
something online would work. Well, guess
what? At Tom''s Key Company, we''ll send
you everything you need to make the
spare key. will cut it beforehand with
our key by photo key cutting service and
you''ll save a bucket of money and it''s
only going to take you 15 minutes. The

today we''re going to take a look at how
to program a remote key fob to a Chevy
Silverado
so in order to do this we''ll need an
ignition key for the vehicle
and all the remotes that you want to
work for it that''s going to include any
that already already are programmed as
they''ll need to be reprogrammed in
during the procedure so here I have my
new unprogrammed key
and here I have my working one
see that one works
this one doesn''t
so what we want to do is take our key
put it in the ignition now we''re going
to press and hold down the unlock button
on the driver''s door and continue to
hold it down so press and keep holding
it down
I''m going to come over to the ignition
I''m going to turn the ignition from on
to off two times and you need to do this
pretty quickly one
two release the unlock button the door
lock cycle there indicating the vehicle
is now in programming mode
so we''ll grab the new remote and we''re
going to hold down both the lock and
unlock button at the same time and
continue to hold those both down until
the door lock cycle again
and sometimes this can take up to 15 or
20 seconds
door lock cycled indicating this remotes
now programmed
now we''ll grab this one same thing press
and hold down the lock and unlock button
continue to hold them down until the
door lock cycle again
this remote''s not successfully
programmed at this point if you have any
additional remotes you''ll repeat that
previous step for each remote pressing
and holding down the unlock button until
the door lock cycle
once you''re done adding remotes you can
turn the ignition to the on
position to exit programming mode
and now let''s take the key out and test
the remotes
so this was our original remote
that one works

if we can add remote start and the
tailgate assist. Well, we''re gonna find
out because I think this truck was
manufactured with those features. I''m
about to show you the fastest, easiest
way to go from one key to having a spare
with the help of Tom''s Key company, this
little programming device, and the magic
of our keyphoto key cutting service.
Let''s jump in this 2020 Silverado and
watch the magic. If you only have one
key for your vehicle, guess what? You''re
like over half of used car owners. Most
used vehicles are sold with a single key
or fob. And we all know we want a
second. If you lose the only key you''ve
got, disaster is waiting to happen. So
come to tomskey.com. We''ll help you make
a spare. You''ll save hours of time and
hundreds of dollars in the process. My
friend Spencer bought this used Fire
Engine Red 2020 Silverado. And he
reached out to me when he sent me a
picture of his key fob. I was a bit
surprised. It was just a basic remote
with lock, unlock, and panic function.
On our website, tommskey.com, we
typically sell the five button version
for a 2020 Silverado. That includes the
remote start feature and the power
tailgate functions. Now, his original
key has the Chevy logo on the back,
which most likely means it''s an original
key from the truck was manufactured. I
told my friend that he was going to end
up with remote start. Let''s see if I''m
right. All right, let''s make a spare
key. Got the original key with the tile
key finder. Pairs to a smartphone, which
you can always find your vehicle. It''s
got the Chevy logo. Now, this one looks
really worn. A little funny. And here''s
the new key. Let''s see if remote start
and tailgate lift assist end up working
when we add this. All going well. This
vehicle should have remote start and the
power liftgate because the vehicle
sticker and all the RPO codes say that
this truck was manufactured with those
features. Now, it is a 2020 year model
and that was the year there were all
sorts of circuit board supply chain
issues. some vehicles that didn''t have
all the features they were supposed to
be manufactured with. All right, let''s
get started. We need to scan the QR code
on the programmer to get going with the
app. With our pair my key app installed,
we can go ahead and begin the
programming. Start here. First step is
getting this guy plugged into the OBD
port. The OBD port is right down by your
gas and brake pedal. Plug this guy in.
I recommend picking up this optional
extension cable so you can see what''s
going on with the programmer. We see
it''s got power here. So, let''s go ahead
and continue. Next step, we need to get
the Bluetooth pairing done. It''s going
to find the serial number on your
programmer. You want to watch for the
comm light to turn on. There we got this
guy paired. We can go ahead and begin
programming. Now, I do want to point out
there''s technical support available.
That''s during regular business hours,
and they do great. You can call them up.
There''s a phenomenal support team
that''ll walk you through any problems.
We''re here to make sure you have success
making a new key or fob for your
vehicle. All right, let''s get underway.
We to enter license plate information.
Sometimes you''ll get this warning. It
can''t find the car. That''s okay. You can
select manually. This is a Chevy
Silverado
and it''s 2020. This is important. Some
vehicles have multiple types of devices.
Remotes to lock and unlock the doors
only, a regular key you put in the
ignition to turn, or a smart key, which
is what we have here, where you push the
start button. So, let''s select our smart
key. Important tips. We want to keep the
app open. Don''t change to other apps
while you''re working on this. Be sure
you''ve got all your working keys. In
this case, we have one with you as well
as our new key. And we want a strong
cell signal or Wi-Fi connection. It
should take just 15 minutes. So, if it
takes longer, you''re going to want to
call technical support. You can contact
them right there. Let''s get going.
Initiating programming. Okay. Couple
things I want to tell you about. We''ve
got our Bluetooth. That''ll probably
disappear as during part of the
programming. Make sure you''re not
drawing the battery down on your
vehicle. Turn off your headlights. Don''t
have the radio or the HVAC running. Roll
the windows down if it''s a hot day. You
don''t want to drain your vehicle
battery. On a lot of General Motors
vehicles like Chevy, GMC, Buick,
Cadillac, if the programming gets
interrupted partway through, it''ll seem
like your original key is no longer
working. But never fear, you just have
to get the vehicle computer reset.
That''s as simple as disconnecting the
vehicle battery, waiting a few minutes,
reconnecting it, and the computer should
be reset and not stuck in programming
process. While we''re waiting for this,
let me show you something else. This is
really important because if your vehicle
battery ever dies or the fob battery
dies, you''re not going to be able to get
in unless you have the emergency
keyblade cut. And we have this awesome
key by photo technology. You simply add
the key by photo service to your order
and then you''ll upload photos of your
existing key and we will cut your new
key so it arrives already fitting your
vehicle. All right, we''re almost ready.
Here we go. Okay, please wait. Notice
the Bluetooth connection just dropped
off. That should come back. There we
are. During programming, it''s pretty
normal to have some lights flashing and
things. Gives us specific instructions.
Now, the app''s going to improve over
time, so make sure you follow the
instructions in the app. The vehicle
engine is turned off, not running. We''re
going to turn on our hazard lights. With
those going, let''s continue
communicating. Please wait. The hazard
lights stop blinking. All right, we''ve
got a pin code 114. You might want to
jot that down. I think the app should
remember it, but 11 194. Configuring the
system. Please wait 45 seconds. Okay.
Oh, my light started blinking again. I''m
seeing some things happen on the
dashboard. Dashboard turned off. The
hazards are still blinking. All right.
Put the new keyless remote into the
programming slot area. This is located
either in the center console or in the
cup holder. If you can''t locate it,
refer to the keys, doors, windows
section of the owner''s manual. Okay, so
we got to take our new remote and find
the programming slot. We''re going to
start by looking in here. Can tell my
buddy just bought this vehicle because
there''s not much in here. I''m not seeing
a programming slot in there unless it''s
under here. Let''s look under this mat.
Still not seeing it. Okay, center cup
holder. Sometimes this rubber part comes
out. Again, I''m not seeing it there.
Sometimes it''ll be this section right
there. So, let''s pull out the trusty
owner''s manual. See what we can find.
Here we go. The owner''s manual.
Transmitter pocket with bucket seats.
So, it does look like it''s in the center
section right there. So, let''s hope we
haven''t taken too long. We''re going to
put our new key right down there. All
right. Quick through the next screens to
safely exit programming. Okay, so the
app seems to pick up. It''s taken me a
little while here. Let''s go ahead and
hit continue and see what happens. Oh,
look at that. Dashboard lit up.
Verifying vehicle security. Please wait.
Logo turned on over there. Lights are
flashing. Oh, here we go. We seem to be
in progress. Security system wait timer.
Please wait for 10 minutes. Okay, so
this goes back to that notice that
sometimes it can take up to 15 minutes.
Here''s one thing I''m noticing as it''s
counting up. Take a look on the
dashboard here. See the little security
light with a lock in the car? That''s a
security indication and commonly
associated with programming a car key.
So, it''s a good thing that that''s turned
on right now. Now, I''m noticing this
light is turned on green here. That''s
also a good sign. Meanwhile, let''s call
the Chevy dealership and see what see
what they say about upgrading to remote
start. I''m trying to find out uh I''ve
got a used 2020 Silverado and I''m trying
to figure out if I can like get remote
start on it. What it takes to get remote
start. Right now, my remote just has
lock and unlock.
Lock and unlock. If if it doesn''t come
with auto start, that''s not a feature
you can add on, unfortunately.
Okay. One other question. What does it
take just to get a spare key? I''ve got
one key for this used truck. What does
that cost?
Is it a is it a push to start key where
you actually have to physically push the
car to start it or or do you have a key
insert where you have to just put the
key in?
Yeah. So, you push the button to start
it?
Push button. Those roughly run around
anywhere from $580 to $600.
Ooh. Okay. Pretty spendy. $580 to $600.
How long does that take?
Couple hours. Couple hours.
About a three, worst case scenario, 5
hour case scenario cuz it does require a
software update. It could be quick or
something could take a little bit of
time.
Okay. So, plan on like half a day at
least then. All right. Thank you so much
for the help.
Can you believe that? That''s absolutely
crazy. $580 to $600 at the Chevy
dealership to make a spare key fob. And
they want the car to be there for as
long as 5 hours. That''s absolutely
crazy. At Tom''s Key Company, you''ll save
hundreds of dollars and hours of time
skipping the car dealership. So, you get
the idea how these calls are going. The
dealerships just don''t really know if we
can add remote start and the tailgate
assist. We''re making some good progress.
Not quite there. Here''s a helpful tip to
know. If your FOB battery has died, you
might be concerned you won''t be able to
start your engine. And the key won''t
work unless you put it into the
programming slot. Then the vehicle''s
sensor can read the fob even if the
battery is dead and you''ll be able to
start the engine. So tuck that in the
back of your mind in case your fob
battery dies. Just going to hold this up
here cuz sometimes we approach the end
of 10 minutes. It''ll actually end before
the 10 minutes is reached. Okay, we
should be done within about 3 minutes.
All right, there we go. Configuring
system. Please wait. I''m noticing that
security light turned off. Oh, there it
turned back on. So again, things going
on with the vehicle computer. The light
on my push button start ended. Oh, now
notice it says ready for remote number
five. So, that''s interesting because
that tells me there''s actually been four
remotes programmed to that vehicle
before, but we''ll talk about the number
of remotes in a minute. Click the start
button one time. Wait five seconds.
Okay, here we go.
One, two, three, four, five. All right,
look at this. Ready for remote number
six. You see that? It looks like we just
programmed a remote and it was remote
number five. If the number does not go
up, click the start button again. Double
check you have the remote in the proper
area. If the dashboard is blacked out,
continue programming the steps anyway.
This is common in Cadillacs. Okay, so
there''s some warnings there. This app
will continue to get better. Programming
keys has some tricks sometimes. So,
let''s continue configuring the system.
Please wait. Now, this is interesting.
Dashboard''s flashing. The blinking sound
of the emergency flasher stopped. Oh,
now it''s started again. Right. So,
there''s definitely stuff going on with
the vehicle computer. Now, asked me if
we have any additional new keys. We want
to program the vehicle. No, we don''t.
We''re done. Configuring the system.
Please wait. Now, this is a part where
it can get a little tricky with GM
vehicles. We want to make sure we
complete these final steps. Otherwise,
it''ll seem like no keys are working. But
don''t worry, we can recover them with
the vehicle battery being unplugged. If
the dashboard is turned on, click the
start button once to turn the ignition
off. Dashboard is turned on, so I''m
gonna click the start button once. Okay,
it turned off and the green light on the
button turned off. Press and hold the
vehicle start button for 15 seconds.
Then click continue. This is the very
important step. 15 seconds. One, two,
three. Oh, it''s giving me a timer.
Excellent. And if you don''t complete
this step, it''s going to seem like all
your keys have been erased. That''s not
really the case. Just the vehicle
computer got froze up. Okay, the ready
for remote message should no longer be
displayed. Yep, it''s gone. If the
message has not gone away, press and
hold the start button for another 12 to
15 seconds. So again, that holding the
start button is a key thing. If that
doesn''t get done quite properly, it''ll
seem like your remotes are all erased.
Again, they''re not erased. Just have to
get get the vehicle computer unfrozen.
All right, since the ready for remote
message is gone, we can hit continue.
Please wait. Do not push the brake
pedal. Press and hold the start button
for 6 to 10 seconds till the dashboard
is fully turned on. Okay, so here we go.
1 2 3 4 5 6 Oh, there. See it all flash
on? Eight nine 10. All right, so I think
my dashboard''s fully turned on. We got
all the lights all over. All right, here
we go. Let''s hit continue. Configuring
the system. Please wait. Let''s hit
continue. Configuring the system. Please
wait. All right. Press the start button
for 2 seconds to turn the ignition off.
Okay. 100 1,002. All right. The light on
the button turned off. The dashboard
turned off. We haven''t started the
engine in any of this process. Okay.
It''s important to be aware of. Open and
close the driver''s door once. Okay.
Opening the door.
Closing the door. The horn beeped at us.
Hit continue. Configuring the system.
Wait about 30 seconds. Now, remember how
our new key fob has power tailgate? I''m
noticing it''s right here on this truck.
This symbol is giving me hope that the
remote will do the trick as well. All
right, hold the brake pedal and push the
start button to start the engine. All
right, I got my foot on the brake. I''m
pushing the button to start the engine.
Boom. The truck fired up. That''s good.
Now remember, if the truck doesn''t fire
up, you can call tech support. They''ll
walk you through it. You just need to
disconnect the vehicle battery. Okay,
let''s hit continue, click the start
button to turn the engine off.
Okay, engine is turned off. Continue
configuring the system. Please wait.
Open and close the driver''s door once.
Okay, opening the door.
Close the door. Vehicle beeped.
Continue. Press the lock button and then
the unlock button on the new remote.
Listen for the locks to click. Okay,
this is the moment of truth. We''re going
to press the lock button and then the
unlock button. Lock. Unlock. Okay, the
lock didn''t actually move, but I heard
it click. Sorry, that click was pretty
faint. Let''s hit continue. If you heard
the locks click, click continue. If the
locks did not respond, make sure the
remote has a new battery. Go ahead and
click this again.
Okay, definitely clicked. Hit continue.
Success.
All right. Okay. Beautiful. We''ve got a
new remote. Let''s check that our lock
and unlock functions work. Here''s our
existing remote. Here''s the old remote.
It still works. Here''s the new remote.
Excellent. It works. I''m going to get my
programmer unplugged.
Oh, look at this. The app tells me
there''s five keys programmed. That
reminds me. Remember how I was a little
uncertain about this key fob? Because we
now have five remotes programmed. We''ve
got one remote here, one remote there.
That means there''s three other remotes
lost somewhere in the world. Almost
certainly the two remotes that came when
this vehicle was manufactured are some
of those ones lost out in the world. And
then somebody had new remotes made, they
lost one of them, and we''re down to this
single one. This is remote number four.
This is remote number five. So, we''re
going to find out in just a minute if
the remote start and the power tailgate
worked because maybe whenever this
remote was made, they didn''t have the
remote start buttons or or they didn''t
know if the remote and tailgate worked,
so they just did one with the lock and
unlock button. Okay, we need to make
sure both these keys are starting the
engine. So, how are we going to do that?
We''re going to start by getting both
keys out of the vehicle.
With those keys out of the vehicle, I
just saw a warning. So, when I push the
brake pedal and try to hit the start
button, the engine should not start.
Yep. Nothing''s happening. Oh, look at
that. And it''s telling me I''ve got to
place the key in the pocket in the
transmitter pocket to start the vehicle.
So, that''s good. That''s clearly what we
want because it''s not recognizing the
remote.
So, I''ve climbed out of the truck with
one remote. Now, we should be able to
start the engine. And if it starts, we
know it''s this new one.
Boom. Look at that.
Everything fired up. Okay, so that''s a
good sign.
Now, let''s check the original one.
Okay, we can bring back in our original
one. Let''s make sure it starts the
engine.
Boom. Excellent. Truck fires up. Both
remotes are working. So, with that,
we''ve got two remotes. the existing one
that turned out to be remote number four
for this truck and the new one, remote
number five. Let''s find out about remote
start. This is the moment of truth I''ve
been waiting for. Does the remote start
work? Let''s find out. Here''s how to use.
You got to lock the vehicle and then
press and hold remote start for 4
seconds. One, two, three. Look at that.
It works. The vehicle has remote start.
The dealerships didn''t even know. We
just made a spare key for my friend and
remote start works. So, remote start
worked. So, the tailgate assist should
work as well. Here we go. Click it
twice. Boom. We just got a new key fob
that has the buttons to access the
original features that the truck was
manufactured with, the remote start and
tailgate assist. Be sure you have at
least two keys for your vehicle. And in
the process, you might just get some
surprising upgrades. Can you believe how

rather serious topic,
the future.
Hello again and welcome back. This is
Hoff here with Papa Northern Colorado
and the Autoropad G2 Turbo. Today we''re
working on a 2023
Chevrolet Silverado with the new style
procs. Have a CANFD adapter installed
and plugged into OBD.
I''ve just updated it a little bit ago.
So on this one, that is the learning
slot. Looked in the owner''s manual to
confirm. Can''t remember if it''s going to
work in that direction or not. So I may
end up needing to work it around a
little bit, but all right. Immobilizer
by vehicle. Chevrolet USA
Silverado 22 and up. Free pin.
All right. So,
going to keep opening closing the door
while it tries to communicate.
It is connected to the internet.
And this is all keys lost.
It is still connected. Yes.
Make sure all keys are away from the
sensing area.
So, ignition can''t be turned on.
No, he found.
[Music]
So, just going to open the door,
close it,
close all doors.
Got the ignition on.
All right. Now, we''ll be back in about
10 minutes. And we''re back. Configuring
system. Please wait a few seconds.
All right. Put the key into the
induction zone, which is not the cup
holder on this one. It is there. Other
keys away.
Key learning active. Press start button
for two seconds.
Ready
for key two, which means it took the
first one.
All right, second key in.
Current number of keys one. Do you need
to program more keys? Yes,
new key is in.
Okay,
press the start button.
Current number of keys too. Do you need
to program more keys? No. Configuring
system.
All right. Press and hold start button
for 16 seconds.
Turn off the ignition. Open the door.
So, ignition is off. Open the door.
Close the door.
Please wait for 40 seconds. But while
that''s going,
get the other key out.
We got our two keys there.
In the interest of accuracy, I''m not
going to skip past this and try and
start it yet. I''m just going to keep
going
as long as it wants to configure the
system so it doesn''t pop a theft light
or anything.
Now, if you''ll notice, the hazards are
still going, but it''s not making the
noise anymore.
And now that noise popped back up again.
So I try and keep that noise always
and you''re trying to get the programmer
to wake up the dash
and say
key left in vehicle. So it is
recognizing both the keys.
Programming finish.

problems. You got a key fob that''s not
programming properly. Here''s how to do
it. You know, a lot of guys will have
troubles on these trucks not programming
the key fob. And I know why. Let''s check
it out. Trust me, I''m a mechanic. All
right. Bubble eye Chevrolet. Oh yeah,
he''s got a bunch of water in there. We
got to drill a little hole to get it to
drain. Look at all that water.
So, this is a 2001 and I''ve been
teasing, you know, showing some stuff on
this thing and it is nice, but he''s got
a key fob. He can''t program it right.
So, let''s check it out. So, the standard
procedure is you put the key in there,
hold the lock, you know, and it should
cycle lock and unlock, but he''s just
hearing the solenoid click. So, I got a
scan tool. You can do this through some
scan tools like the TEG 2 will do it.
But yeah, nothing''s happening. And uh
guys keep telling me this. Yes, you just
heard it click. Nothing happened. Guys
keep telling me this. uh they do it.
Doesn''t work. Doesn''t work. Doesn''t
work. I do believe on some of these
trucks, uh there was only a certain
amount of key fobs allowed to be synced.
You had to clear them out. So, let''s try
this scan tool.
So, here it is. Full review coming soon.
Think car. This thing is nice, guys. I''m
telling you, I''ve been using this every
day now. And uh so, here it is. It''s got
Bluetooth on the back. I''m going to have
him plug it up. We''re going to see. I
already saw the procedure in here. Here.
Go ahead. Stick that in there. Bow OBD2.
Get it in there. Get this thing fixed.
It''s hot out here.
So, let''s turn it on. See what we got
going on in here.
So, I''ll get to procedure and then I''ll
show y''all. All right. So, it''s under
body control module right here. Program
key fobs. Should work.
See how it does. I''ll get the tech too
if it doesn''t do it on this. All fobs
must be programmed at the same session.
Blah blah blah. Press and hold the lock
and unlock buttons at the same time.
When all key fobs are programmed, cycle
the ignition. All right. Hold the lock
and unlock.
The key fobs
start.
All right, I press start. Let''s see if
it does it. You''re holding them down.
You should hear it cycle. If that
battery is any good, we might have
checked battery. Replace the battery.
I''ve seen that before.
But yeah, it''s doing its thing. Let''s
see if it''ll get it.
So, it wasn''t working. That battery
wasn''t any good. We got a new one. We''re
popping it in there. I got me a value
pack right here. So, had to get that.
What is it? CR 2032. So, we''re going to
restart the scan tool here. Should work.
So, these key fobs can be a real pain.
Sometimes it doesn''t work. If it doesn''t
work on this truck, I''ll show y''all why.
But I''m going to do my best to get it
programmed.
All right, hold them down.
All right, so you''re supposed to hold
unlock and then cycle it on, off, on,
off. Do it again, and then it should
click, but it doesn''t work half the
time.
All right, look. Here''s the deal. The
scan tool works great. The key fob works
great. Fresh battery. Can''t program it.
Guys keep having this problem. You keep
telling me, "I can''t program it. I can''t
program it. I can''t program it." No
matter what you do, you get in the
programming mode, doesn''t work. So, this
truck is not going to be able to get
programmed without replacing the
wireless receiver module. and the
customer has refused that service. So,
I''m going to show you where it is. If
you got this problem, I would recommend
swapping out that module and then it
should program right away. So, on the
dash right here, the module sits right
up here and it is a pain to get to. It''s
under all this plastic stuff and uh you
got to take all this stuff apart to get
in there and you know, guys don''t want
to do it. It''s not that expensive, but
it''s such a pain because it''s up under
there. And I have the exact same problem
on the Chevrolet Avalanche.
So the Chevrolet Avalanche has the same
exact problem. And we''ll dig into it one
day. You know, I''ll get it fixed. But
same problem up there in the dash. Let
me show y''all. It''s got the same
problem. And I know it''s that receiver
thing cuz you know, you can''t program it
even with the Tech 2. Nothing
under here. I got half of mine to just
hit on it. Program. Program. Program.
But, uh, yeah, it''s up under here. Pain
to get to. So, all right. So, the first
thing I want you to do if your key fob''s
not working, get you some rubbing
alcohol and clean up all four of these
contacts and clean up these three
contacts right here. And then let it
dry. Uh, put your new battery in there
and it should work. If it doesn''t work
at that point, you''re going to have to
dig deeper and, you know, try some more
stuff first. But, you know, normally
these are just dirty from being in
pockets and purses and whatnot. they
don''t make good electrical contact and
the buttons just don''t work. So, the
buttons don''t work and then guys think
their truck''s broken and it''s not. You
know, get you a new key fob or clean up
your old one first.
All right, so here''s another tip real
quick. Um, you know, guys will try a
different key fob because if you look at
them, they''re the same. Um, they''ve
talked about these FCC codes. Uh, you
know, it''s not right for the truck to
make the model. You know, is there any
truth to that? I don''t know. You know,
it''s worth trying a different key fob if
it''s not sinking. I''d do that before I
tore into the dash and, you know, got
the module out and did all that. I mean,
that''s the one that came with the cat
eye. This was a replacement. Typically,
if they look the same, they are the
same. You know, they should work. I
mean, if it says it works for that year,
make, model, you know, uh, this FCC code
on the back, y''all let me know down
below if anybody said, "You know what? I
got a different one with a different
code and it actually worked without
having to replace the module." I''d like
to know myself, but as far as I know, if
they look the same, they should work the
same.
So, we''ve tried all these different key
fobs, new batteries. This one works on
the red uh cat eye. I''ll show you that.
But, yeah, they work. You can''t you
can''t program them. It''s impossible. The
code''s not getting sent. The signal is
not getting sent from that module or
whatever it is. But, yeah, this one,
this one, I mean, you can get new ones.
This one works good. I know it works
good. Can''t program it. Signal is not
coming out. and it worked flawlessly on
this uh bubble eye, but you know, that
module looks to be bad. So, it is what
it is. Scan tool worked good, though.
All right, so I''m in the ''06 cat eye
right now. I''m going to show y''all
programming this thing easy. This one
will get programmed easy. You know, like
I said, um the newer trucks, you know,
to 2007,
I feel like they updated it. I don''t
know. I hadn''t taken many of the dashes
apart on these things, but I feel like
they updated um the key fob setup on
this. There''s a lot less problems. It''s
a lot more robust than the older trucks,
but I will tell you for a fact those
older trucks, the key fob does stop
working on them. I mean, we got two
sitting right here where it doesn''t
work. So, let''s show you how easy it is
to program it on those six.
All right, so check it out. Program all
key fobs. Program individual key fob.
We''ll do that. Um, it''s going to tell
you blah blah blah blah blah. You can
have like four of them. So, there''s four
of them right there. Now, this happens
so fast on these. I''m actually going to
have to hold this down while I press
this. Going to be very difficult to do
on camera, but I''m going to do it.
And there we go. It''s done. See? Just
like that. All right. So, there we go.
Programmed instantly. Just like that. No
problems at all. I''m telling y''all,
these newer cat eyes are easier to
program.
So, this is an '' 06, and that module
should be up under the dash under here.
Um, same as the 01, 02, Avalanche, but,
you know, we got it programmed and, uh,
yeah, it works great. I just get these
on Amazon, you know, brand new key fobs
and, uh, get them programmed easy.
See,
no problems on this truck. and it still
wouldn''t program. So, if you want to
know the technical name for it, it''s
called an RCDLR
module. It goes right under the dash on
all these trucks, but the ''06 cat eye
doesn''t seem to have any problems. I bet
you they updated it cuz I never had any
problems programming key fobs on these
trucks. It''s only the older ones. So,
there you go. All right. So, that''s it
for the video. You know, if you got a
problem, replace the module. I mean, it
should just work by holding down the
buttons. The problem is the heat gets to
it, probably breaks the solder points in
there. I''m about to take one apart when
I get out of the Avalanche and get it
fixed up. But this should help somebody
so that you know where the problem is
and you can get it fixed. I will check
you out on the next video. Don''t forget
to drop me a huge thumbs up down below.

hello world this is random fix and today
I''m going to show you how to program
your ford keyless entry and this happens
to be a 2004 Ford Mustang and this is
really easy you don''t need any tools all
you''re gonna need is just one key and
however many report remotes you want to
go ahead and put the key in the ignition
and we''re gonna be toggling the key a
total of eight times and what you want
to do is pay close attention to the
actual door lock right there I''m gonna
be toggling the key from this position
to that position where the ignition
turns on and back back to the ignition
and I''m gonna do this a total of eight
times I''m gonna show you guys what that
actually looks like so here''s what
you''re looking for toggle what I just
did one two three four five six seven
eight
right there right when the door locks go
up and down go ahead and hit any button
on the remote
it could be unlock lock and when you''re
once you''re done whatever everybody
remotes you''re using remove the key and
now we can see both of the remotes are
working and this same procedure works
for a lot of other Ford''s as well I''ll
have a link to these remotes you can get
them for like five six bucks and a lot
of times they''ll be ok as far as the
quality the remote the battery numbers
give me pretty poor so you want to throw
a nice Panasonic battery in there so
that way it''ll actually last you a
couple of years instead of a few months

&gt;&gt; In this video, I will explain how to
program your Ford Mustang key fob. This
simple do-ityourself method can save you
a trip to the dealership. Before we
begin, please gather all the key fobs
you intend to program, including any
existing ones. This procedure will reset
all current fobs, so they must all be
reprogrammed together. You can program
up to four key fobs in one session.
To start, insert your ignition key into
the ignition cylinder. Now, you''ll need
to quickly turn the key from the off
position to the run position eight
times. Make sure to do this within a
10-second window and finish with the key
in the run position. You''ll know you''ve
successfully entered programming mode
when your vehicle''s door lock cycle,
meaning they will lock and then unlock.
Once your Mustang is in programming
mode, it''s time to program each key fob.
Take your first key fob and press any
button on it within 10 seconds. The door
locks will cycle again, confirming that
this fob has been successfully
programmed. If you have additional key
fobs, repeat this step for each one,
pressing a button on each remote within
10 seconds of the previous one.
Remember, all fobs must be programmed in
this single session. To exit programming
mode, simply turn your ignition key to
the off position. The door locks will
cycle one last time, indicating that the
programming sequence is complete. Now,
remove the key from the ignition. It''s
important to test all your newly
programmed key fobs to ensure they are
working correctly. Try locking and
unlocking your doors with each one. If
any fob isn''t working, you may need to
repeat the entire process.

on vehicle programming routine, explain
common error lights, and offer
troubleshooting tips for when a fob
still refuses to sync, all in clear,
friendly language for hands-on doers.
Begin by inserting the master key and
cycling the ignition between off and run
positions as required by your Corolla
model to trigger programming mode. When
the system signals readiness, press the
lock button on the new fob firmly and
promptly. Then repeat for additional
remotes. Finish by turning the ignition
off and testing each function from
inside and outside the vehicle to ensure
full remote operation and door lock
response. If programming fails, first
swap in a fresh battery and retry the
sequence since weak batteries often
cause issues. Confirm the replacement
fob matches your Corolla''s frequency and
compatibility because many aftermarket
units look similar but lack programming
support. If problems persist, use a
latch and key diagnostic. Check for
blown fuses. and consider contacting a

&gt;&gt; In this video, I will explain how to
program a Honda Civic key fob. First,
gather all key fobs you intend to
program, including any that currently
work. Make sure your car battery is
fully charged to avoid interruptions.
This process involves a specific
sequence of steps that must be followed
carefully. We''ll walk through each part
to ensure your new or replacement key
fob functions correctly. It''s a
straightforward process once you
understand the timing. To begin, sit in
the driver''s seat and ensure all doors
are securely closed. Insert your key
into the ignition and turn it to the on
position, but do not start the engine.
Within 4 seconds of turning the key,
press the lock button on one of the key
fobs you wish to program. This action
helps initiate the vehicle''s programming
mode. You''ll hear a distinct click or
sound confirming entry. Now, turn the
key to the off position, then
immediately back to on within 4 seconds.
Again, press the lock button on the same
key fob within 4 seconds. You need to
repeat this entire on, off, on, lock
sequence two more times. The car''s door
locks will cycle, indicating successful
entry into the programming phase. This
confirms the vehicle is ready to learn
the key fob signal. Once the locks
cycle, press the lock button on every
key fob you want to program, including
any existing ones, within 10 seconds.
The locks will cycle again after each
successful registration. After
programming all fobs, turn the ignition
key to the off position to exit the
programming mode. Test each key fob to
ensure all functions like lock and
unlock work correctly. Remember to check
the description for a link to the OALA
water bottle and other great deals.

                             VALUES ('nKenS2gO9ZM', 'hey it''s Alex here and welcome to this
video on transponder key programming so
what I''m going to do is give you a quick
overview about what we''re going to learn
in this lesson and then at the end of
this lesson you''re also going to see a
live demonstration of me programming a
car key so let''s get into it so what
we''re going to cover are what are
transponder Keys how a mobilizer systems
work and the process of cloning and
programming transponder key
so let''s get into it so what are
transponder keys so in basic terms a
transponder key is a car key that
contains a small microchip inside that
microchip communicates with the car''s
immobilizer system and allows the engine
to start so here''s how that works when
the key is IGN inserted into the
ignition that chip in the in the key the
micr chip the transponder sends a signal
to the ECU usually an RD signal radio
signal if that code matches the car
starts now if the code doesn''t match the
car won''t start so even if the key
physically fits even if it turns the
lock it will not start the car now
obviously this is this was invented to
prevent people stealing cars that''s the
main use of this so that''s just
something simple to understand at this
stage um so for an example a 2005 Ford
Focus uses a transponder key while a
1995 Toyota Corolla does not so with the
Toyota Corolla you''d be able to actually
cut a key to it um if you had the
original key you could simply duplicate
that key turn the ignition and drive
away whereas with a 2005 Ford Focus even
if you cut the key to it correctly it
wouldn''t start the engine you would need
this transponder in the key to make it
start so the different types of
transponders are fixed code transponders
so these us a single code for all keys
rolling Co code or often called crypto
uh transponders generate a new code
every time the key is used so this is
obviously an extra layer of security so
literally every time the the key is used
it will write itself a new code and then
you''ve got a encrypted trans trans
bonders which are more advanced and
harder to clone so some common Brands so
Ford Toyota and Honda use these rolling
code crypto transponders BMW and
Mercedes for example use the high
security encrypted
transponders now a quick tip is the type
of transponder key determines whether it
can be cloned or programmed into the ECU
so you might have circumstances where a
customer might come to you you ask for a
duplicate key it''s not as
straightforward just to uh duplicate
that key you would need to program a new
key into the vehicle and then program
the existing key as well so you just got
to keep that in mind it really depends
on the make and model so how do these
immobilizer systems work then so what is
an immobilizer so it''s an anti- theft
system that prevents the car from
starting without the program key it
works by verifying the chip signal from
the key before allowing ignition and the
key components of this are the
transponder key itself so this is the
physical key with the transponder inside
the chip inside the antenna ring so this
is the often known as the reader coil
this is what goes around the uh actual
ignition
itself and that reads the signal from
the key and then you''ve got the ECU
which is essentially like the the car''s
brain so this is where it stores
programmed key codes and many other
things for the vehicle um so that''s like
the if you think of that as like the
brain to the vehicle so here''s an
example so if a thief cuts a new metal
key for a car but doesn''t have it
programmed um with the transponder the
immobilizer will prevent the engine from
starting now if you did program the
correct transponder to the vehicle
you could then start the car so how to
use a key programmer to to clone keys so
what is key cloning so key cloning is
copying the transponder chip data onto a
blank
transponder so any simple example a
customer comes to you with a working key
you''re able to read that that chips data
using your machine and then transfer
that data onto a blank chip onto a new
chip so this works best for fix code
transponders so the steps to that don''t
worry I''m going to get into a visual
demonstration of this but just to give
you an outline you would insert the
original key into the programmer read
and copy the chip data then insert the
new blank transponder key write the copy
data onto that new key and test to make
sure the key
starts now common Key Programs for we
have covered that in another lesson so
if you haven''t got the full course for
this uh there''s a link in the
description where you can get this
entire course for free um so that would
be an ex xhorse an utel or smart key
programmer and one thing to keep in mind
is not all transponders can be cloned
now some require ECU programming instead
um so another thing to to keep in mind
here is um when it comes to these fixed
codes transponders you you might think
that your business if you''re just
starting in this business now you might
think that the common house uh the
common High Street Key Cutters are
competing with you because well can''t
they just copy any key and uh go ahead
well the truth is they can''t because the
when it comes to these crypto
transponders with the rolling data
they''re not going to be able to do most
of them because they''re going to need to
actually physically leave their shop and
pro um plug the machine the the key
programmer into the vehicle and do it
that way they'' need to program a key
from scratch and not many High Street
shops offer that also if the customers
lost all the keys to their vehicle most
of these High Street Key Cutters don''t
physically have the staff or the
capability of leaving the shop going out
on site picking and decoding in the car
uh cutting the key and so on so you need
to think that you''re not in danger by
these key cutting shops and often they
will call you if you go around some of
these key cutting shops hand them your
business card they will actually send
you plenty of work uh which they can''t
dosel so let''s talk about adding keys so
this is instead of cloning uh this will
be when a new key is registered directly
into the ECU so this is is required for
Rolling code and encrypted transponders
and often when an original key isn''t
present so the steps of doing this is
you would connect your key programmer to
the car''s o OBD Port now we''re going to
get into this in
another shortly you''re going to get a
visual demonstration of this but the obb
port is essentially just a socket in the
car that''s usually hidden in the
footwell area where you plug your key
programming machine into and that would
allow you to talk directly to the ECU um
rather than using radio signals so you
would select the cars make model and
year you would enter the pin or security
code if required it''s not always
required then you would insert the new
key with obviously the correct
transponder in and follow the onscreen
programming steps and then you would
obviously test the key to make sure it
starts so as you can see this is really
just pushing buttons so if you can
operate an iPhone or you know a simple
laptop you can do this because it''s
really we''re not talking about any Dex
dextrous skill here there''s no uh you
don''t need to train for years to be able
to to learn how to just follow the
onscreen programming steps you just need
to be able to know um obviously the
correct parts to use and then to be able
to follow follow these instructions that
the machine''s going to give you so some
common key programmers are an utel smart
Pro and the key tool plus um and an
example might be a 2012 Honda Accord
requires ECU programming while a 2004
Fiesta can be cloned so let''s say a
customer comes to you with a 2012 Honda
Accord um and you''ll you can''t just
simply duplicate their key um whereas
with a for 2000 uh Ford Fiesta you''ll be
able to just simply clone the key uh
clone the
transponder so here''s some issues and
solutions so what happens if a car won''t
start after programming usually you need
to check if the ecu''s accepted the key
ensure that the key is correctly uh
coded verify that the transponder chip
is compatible so one of the main
mistakes people make is is trying to try
trying to program the wrong chip to the
vehicle so you need to make sure uh you
can double check to make sure you''re
using the correct transponder now the
key programmer can''t communicate with
the ECU so you need to check if your if
this car requires a security pin code
now most of the time your key programmer
will be able to read the PIN code the
security pin code for the vehicle or the
customer customer will actually have
this pin code without even knowing it so
usually it''s actually in the car in the
glove box in their uh log book for the
vehicle you can often find the PIN code
in there and you can also call the
dealership where the cars purchased from
and retrieve the PIN code from there but
usually your key programming machine
will actually read the PIN code itself
uh so make sure you''re you''re putting in
the correct PIN code make sure the OBD
sockets working and make sure you also
have a a battery tester plugged in as
well battery booster because that will
also um improve the communication
between the key programmer and the
ECU so what happens if your duplicate
key doesn''t work after you''ve programmed
it sometimes it might say that it''s
programmed successfully but it still
doesn''t work now just obviously ensure
the chip was cloned correctly by going
through the procedure again or you can
try manually adding that key to the ECU
rather than cloning it okay so you might
try and clone a key it doesn''t work you
can then try and add it manually so a
good tip is to always have multiple key
programming tools uh to make sure you''ve
got good coverage but don''t start off
like that purchase the most basic key
programmer you can find and get your
feet wet first get confident using it
and then eventually when the market
demands it you''ll know when the right
time to purchase more equipment so now I
invite you to watch a key cutting
demonstration so what I want you to do
when you watch this um in this
demonstration is to observe how the
original key is read so we''re going to
talk about a key dup uh key duplication
here identify the programming process so
how straightforward it is just push in
the buttons and take notes on the steps
and tool used so your goal for this
lesson really is to understand the full
process before attempting key
programming on an actual vehicle so
let''s check the video out and you''re
just going to select the
vehicle the make is a
Ford which is
European and the model is a
Transit go to Transit and we know it''s
the
2012 so we go between 2007 to
2013 select that we know it''s bladed now
it''s just going to literally tell us
what to do switch ignition on and press
enter now you want to be looking at the
dash lights in this moment the moment
you can see we got a red flashing light
there so back to this press enter
this is just going to find the vehicle
so it''s found it press
enter and now special
functions you can see the radio''s come
on
already and we want to go to add key
little says one token will be used
that''s fine is this you is this
something to do with you now it''s just
doing its
thing Keys program free now it''s saying
press back to exit or end to program
next key that''s it and back to exit
procedure complete press
enter now if we look at the dash
now we''ll see that it''s flashing
slowly okay so if we just turn that
off we''ll turn off the
ignition always unplug the ODB before
you test it that''s just a little thing I
like to do I don''t know if makes a
difference but I prefer to do that um if
we turn the ignition on now you see the
red light comes on but it''s gone off so
that''s a good sign if we just turn the
ignition now make sure it''s out of
gear there we go we have lift off give
it a few revs to charge the
battery and there we go okay so I hope
you enjoyed that demonstration there so
here''s a quick summary of this lesson so
transponder keys are used uh as
chip-based security to prevent theft
immobilized systems require a part
programmed key to start the engine key
cloning works for fixed code
transponders when an original keys
present while rolling codes require ECU
programming using key programmers
locksmith can add the Del and reprogram
keys so what I want you to do if you

we''ll be programming a brand new out of
thebox key fob purchased off Amazon for
15 bucks and the scan tool required to
make it all
work so what I''m going to do is record
the screen this scan tool is
unbelievable it''s really a dealer level
scan tool at a DIY price and I uploaded
a video last week on this scan tool if
you want to check it out so not only can
we program a key fob this vehicle is 19
years old 19 and you may think wow
that''s pretty darn old why do you need
this well we need it in this case on the
CTSV but you can also do many other
functions if you want to program your
ECU for whatever the reason if you want
to do bir directional control what that
means is if you want to activate any ABS
at any wheel you want to check the
cooling fans you want to check your door
locks you want to check why you you
don''t have a light coming on or turning
off on the dash you can do Limitless
things with this and $330 I know it''s a
lot of money but for $330 using it twice
you got your money back you really do so
system
selection and every vehicle is this is
going to read a little bit differently I
tried this off camera just to find the
right function and in this case it is
remote function actuation
now regarding how much this will cost
without a scan tool the local special
functions the local locksmith charges
$150 so if this is your only thing that
you''ll ever do pay the 150 but if you''re
a
diyer you need this you really really do
the dealership interestingly
enough program key fobs he said that the
cost starts at $2.99 now what does that
mean I don''t know is is this vehicle
$299 or is it
$4.99 I don''t know so of course you''re
better off at the uh locksmith so okay
let''s rock and roll here so in this case
I just want to do one
key now it just unlocked all the doors
so we''re going to press and hold the
lock and
unlock now okay here we go
okay now this cycled lock and
unlock after a few seconds and it''s
still it''s saying just hold it and I''m
just holding these buttons anyway just
in case so I don''t know once it Cycles
usually that''s it you''re done but just
in case I''m just holding on that''s why
you see the timer going up to close to 7
minutes it''s like anything else with
with these tools you sort of have to use
them a couple times to figure everything
out but a few more seconds and we''ll see
how we turn
out Yes program
successful let''s
see it works lock
unlock perfect let''s try the
trunk amazing absolutely amazing like I
said in the previous video I will have a
playlist or I do have a playlist that
you will find below so this will now be
the second video for this scan tool and
over time I''ll keep adding videos which
just to give you one more idea because
this recently came up you know these old
GM products man it''s just the build
quality is not the greatest when I first
turn on the vehicle what I first thought
so at first I thought a CD was stuck
here it just sounded like the radio was
attempting to read a disc but it''s
really this guy right here and what''s
happening let me see if I can get this
on camera for you you
guys now as you can see there''s no CD in
here so I quickly jumped over to the
scan tool just like before an auto
search and the scan tool picked up the
fault code so not only can you record
the screen you can take
screenshots and I took a screenshot of
of the issue airflow position command so
in other words the diverter that''s what
it sounds like to me so in other words
do you want the air to come out through
the front vent your legs the defroster
that''s having an issue and because this
is by directional the next step for me
is to start commanding the diverter and
pinpoint where the problem is so it just
goes to show you and not only can you
program a key fob you can do Limitless
things things with this scan tool as
always I hope this was helpful and thank

hey guys what''s up Derek with Advanced
love Automotive welcome back to the
channel welcome back to another video
now as promised before on my channel I
did tell you guys that I was gonna start
doing some videos getting more into the
locksmithing and key programming side of
the industry I''ve recently discovered a
passion with this side of the industry
I''ve been doing it now for almost a year
and I want to show you guys some of the
things that I''ve learned so maybe I can
help some of you guys that are
interested in getting into this field
not one of the most common questions
that I see asked over and over again by
aspiring locksmiths is what equipment
should I buy what is the best key
programmer where should I start so in
this series of videos I''m going to try
and help you guys decide what key
programmer slash key tool is best for
you now I will preface this video by
saying there is not one key programmer
that does everything so if you guys are
looking for that magic bullet that one
key programmer that just does everything
well I got bad news for you guys it
doesn''t exist in this industry you''re
going to find out that you pretty much
are required to buy many different
programmers in order to cover as many
vehicles as possible but what I hope to
do with this video is give you guys a
starting point show you guys the tool
that I use for almost 90 percent of the
vehicles that I program keys for so over
here in my toolbox as you guys can see
I''ve got all of my most commonly used
key programmers and key tools starting
over here on the left I have the X tool
ik618 over here I''ve got the autel im508
over here to the right we''ve got the
launch x431 emo plus over here I''ve got
the xhorse key tool Max here I''ve got
the key DIY kdx2 and I have my xhorse
mini key tool however the one I want to
show you guys in this video is this
little bad boy right here this is the
autel km100 now unlike the im508 the
km100 was designed to be more of a
portable handheld key tool but let me
make this clear the autel cam 100 is not
a complete substitute for the im508 if
you guys are looking to do more eprom
work and keys for European cars the
im508 coupled with the XP P400 is
probably going to be your choice however
for the majority of cars here in North
America the km100 is going to be able to
do a majority of the vehicles on the
road plus it has some built-in features
that does not come with the im508 and
they have to be purchased as an extra
add-on so with that being said let''s
delve a little bit deeper into this game
100 and find out what it''s capable of
now before we dig deeper into this tool
I do want to take a quick moment to show
you guys everything that comes in the
kit when you buy it so first of all we
have the unit itself which is roughly
about the size of my iPhone and so it''s
a very portable unit and it''s also about
half the price of the iPhone over here
we have the Bluetooth wireless dongle
that also has a built-in light so if you
push this button it''s got a little
flashlight in there to help you find the
OBD2 port you also get this cable which
is USBC to USBC in order for you to
connect the dongle to the unit in some
applications it will advise you to
connect it using the wire there are some
vehicles that you don''t want to program
wirelessly so always make sure to have
this cable at the ready over here as you
can see they give you a charging cable
and a charging block the kit also comes
with two Universal IQ these are
universal Smart keys that can be
generated to many different applications
they also come in various button
configurations we''re going to get a
little bit deeper into these later on in
the video over here we have the cable
that''s used to do remote renews which
basically allows us to unlock previously
locked keys some smart keys on some
Vehicles will become locked whenever
they''re programmed to a car and so
before you can reuse it and program it
to another vehicle you may have to
unlock it that''s what this cable is for
now this really only applies to OEM keys
not really aftermarket Keys which by the
way if you guys are going to be using
the universal eye keys there really is
no need to unlock the keys these can be
regenerated over and over again as many
times as you like so even if you program
this to a car and then something happens
maybe the customer doesn''t want this key
so you want to be able to reuse it on a
different vehicle you can absolutely do
that all you have to do is regenerate
the key using the tool so now we know
everything that comes in the kit let''s
go ahead and dig deeper into the unit
all right guys so here''s the main menu
as you can see we have quite a few
different functions so starting up here
at the top you can see we have our
Universal key that is to generate our
Universal eye Keys now I will get a
little bit deeper into these because
these Universal eye keys are actually
really awesome and they can save you a
ton of money especially when it comes to
having to inventory keys but we''ll get
into that a little bit later in the
video next up you can see we have
reading and cloning which is basically a
function that allows you to read the
chip inside of the key and also clone it
over here we have a transponder function
which we can use to generate
transponders over here we have a
frequency detection where we can test
our remotes down here we have the emo
function which is the immobilizer
function that''s what we''re going to use
in order to program the keys then we
have some more special functions down
here we''ll get into that in a minute let
me start off by selecting reading and
cloning so basically let''s go in here
and we''re going to read a key it''s
instructing us to put either a chip into
the chip hole right here or put your key
into this hole so right now I have this
key for a Chevy Cruze let''s go ahead and
stick it into the slot right here and
then we''re going to hit read it''s
reading the transponder inside the key
and here we can see all the information
about this key up here you can see we
have a chip model we have an emo type
it''s telling us it''s a high Tag 2 id46
it''s giving us a transponder ID the lock
status which basically tells you whether
or not the key is locked this key is
programmed to a vehicle so right now if
you wanted to try to reuse this key on
another vehicle you would first have to
unlock it which means you''d have to open
it up take the circuit board out use a
special function in the key tool along
with this cable like I mentioned before
unlock the chip then you can reprogram
it to another vehicle now as far as
cloning the chip in this key basically
you drop this in there and we''re going
to hit clone now this is a transponder
46 so whenever you clone these Keys it
does require that you do a password
calculation so what the tool instructs
you to do is put the antenna of this
tool up against the ignition coil I''m
referring to the antenna around the
keyhole where you stick the key in it''s
going to detect the coil around the
ignition then it''s going to calculate
the password and allow you to write it
to a clone chip now here''s where it''s
asking you to put the tool up against
the ignition coil you can see that''s the
key going into the keyhole and
essentially every time you insert the
key and turn the key on there''s a signal
that''s being passed back and forth
between the Chip And also the antenna
the autel is going to pick that signal
up it''s going to calculate the password
then it''s going to allow you to clone it
to a chip so we''ve got the key tool
pressed up against the ignition coil I''m
going to go ahead and stick the key in
turn the ignition on
and we may have to do this a few times
so key off take the key out put the key
back in turn it on
do it again
basically just do this until it tells
you whether or not it acquired the
signal
there we have it it is now calculating
as you can see it calculated our
password so that was just a brief
overview of the cloning function of this
tool next up I wanted to show you guys
the transponder function so if we click
on that you can see up here at the top
we have transponder generation so this
is where you would generate a
transponder so if you go down here let''s
say a Ford 4d63 if you wanted to
generate one of these chips of course
you would have to buy whatever chip
works with this tool so if we back out
this second option here is pretty cool
this is a transponder simulation and so
basically what this allows you to do is
use the tool to simulate a key chip now
moving back to the home page let''s go
ahead and click on frequency detection
this is something very useful especially
if you have a remote that''s not working
and you''re not sure if the problem is
with the remote or with the vehicle you
can just use this function to test the
frequency of the remote so I''m going to
go ahead and unlock this you guys can
see how it just registered the frequency
and it tells us what frequency the key
is so I''m going to click it again
you guys can see this remote is 315
megahertz now we''re going to go into
special functions and here''s where
you''re going to find a lot of cool
different things that you can do first
of all you can do key unlocking again if
you guys have a key an OEM key that was
previously locked to another vehicle you
can use this tool to renew that key so
here we''re in the Dodge menu let''s just
pick any of these you can see they give
you a little diagram right here of how
to connect to the circuit board using
the supplied cable you basically have to
solder to the points on the board then
you hit unlock and it will unlock the
key now another function that you can
use this for is unlocking Toyota Smart
keys this function is very easy to do
you don''t have to open the key there''s
no soldering involved you basically just
stick the key into the slot up here hit
unlock and it will unlock the key now
let me warn you guys Toyota Keys
starting from 2018 2019 and up a lot of
those keys cannot be unlocked I know
this personally because I ran into one
on a 2020 where I use the key tool to
unlock the key and even when I use the
key tool to read the key again it showed
that it was unlocked however it would
not program back into the vehicle on
those newer Toyotas once the keys are
locked they''re locked for good another
function that you can do here is you can
do button adjustment which basically
means that if you generate a universal I
key and program it to the vehicle and
for whatever reason the button
Arrangement is not correct let''s say
when you push the lock button the doors
unlock and when you push the unlock
button the doors lock and you need to
switch those button Arrangements all you
got to do is take the key Stick it into
the slot select the button adjustment
and you can switch them around however
you like okay so I have another
Universal I key that has a battery in it
and so we''re going to slide it in here
we''ll hit retry it''s detecting the
universal remote and here we have our
button functions again you can see that
the unlock icon is unlocked the lock
icon is lock remote start is remote
start the trunk button is the trunk and
the Panic is the Panic so again you can
go in here and you can move them around
so let''s say that you wanted to move the
unlock button and make it the lock you
could just select lock and then you want
it to make the lock button the unlock
button you can go in there and select
unlock and now all you have to do is
confirm writing and this will write that
button adjustment into the key you can
see it''s writing it right now and now
you can see that the unlock icon is now
the lock button and the lock icon is now
the unlock button you can also do
combination buttons where if there''s
another function let''s say like a
convertible top and your key doesn''t
have that button you could do a
combination where in this case if you
push the remote start and the trunk
button at the same time you can make it
work for let''s say a convertible top
lots of really cool stuff that you can
do with these Universal eye keys and
just as easy as it was to change the
button configurations you can just as
easily restore the initial value by just
clicking here and it restores everything
back to the way it was now another cool
special function that you can use is
this ignition coil detection this is
useful when you have a vehicle that''s a
no start and you''re not sure whether the
problem is in the key or the antenna
coil on the vehicle so if we select
ignition coil detection all you got to
do is take the antenna on top of the
tool right here put it up against the
antenna on the vehicle put the key in
turn it and see whether not you''re
getting a signal very useful to have
some other special functions that you
have are these Mazda id49 smart key
warning lamp clearings basically on some
Mazdas when you program a key to them if
the key is not the exact or correct FCC
ID or the correct button Arrangement or
sometimes if it''s an aftermarket key the
vehicle may still start and run with the
key but you''re going to get a light on
the dash this function is used to help
you get rid of that light there''s also a
function for the Nissan Infiniti and
there''s another Universal key bot
adjustment I''m not exactly sure what
that does guys but if you need it it''s
there now moving into the immobilizer
side I''m not going to go too much into
detail right now because I am going to
be showing you how to program a key on a
Nissan later on in this video but
basically when you come in here you can
see that you have all different
manufacturers that you can program keys
for everything from domestic import
Europeans the list goes on and on if you
guys are not sure about compatibility
you can go on to the autel website and
they do have a compatibility chart where
you can go in there put the tool that
you''re working with the make and model
and see what you can and cannot do with
it we also have a selection here for
automatically identifying the VIN now I
will mention that the tool works best as
long as you''re connected to the internet
so wherever you''re going to program Keys
make sure you take a Wi-Fi hotspot with
you a lot of times I just use my phone
as a hotspot and that usually works good
enough so now that we''ve covered
everything else let me take you guys
into the big reason that I love this
tool and that is the universal key
generation function basically what this
allows us to do is it allows us to
generate over 700 plus FCC IDs for all
different makes and models of course
this function only works with the autel
universal eye keys but the selection of
I Keys is really awesome I''m going to
show you guys here in a little bit my
inventory of autel keys these here are
just the basic design but they do have
these keys in OEM form that look just
like the OEM keys but before we get into
that let''s go ahead and click on the
function here for Universal key now
here''s where we can find the key that
we''re looking for you can do this a
couple different ways you can put in the
VIN number you can put in the license
plate number or you can just come in
here and put your make and model so
let''s go ahead and select a Chevrolet
we''ll choose a model let''s say a
Trailblazer and we''ll choose a year
2020. you can see the reference FCC ID
number is a
hyq4ea that''s what the key originally
looks like now autel does have a
universal key that looks pretty similar
to this one it''s not the exact same one
it''s the one for the Cadillac but I''ve
had a lot of luck selling the Cadillac
style to people who have this type of
key but even if you don''t have that key
you can always use just one of these
Universal keys so let''s go ahead and
generate it I''m going to select it it
tells us to go ahead and put the
universal key in the slot now of course
you want to make sure that you put a
battery in your key these keys do not
come with batteries so you do have to
buy them now we''re going to go ahead and
select generate Universal key
it''s acquiring the universal key
information and now it''s generating our
key
okay so our Universal key is generated
that probably took about a minute or so
so here when you''re done you want to
just go ahead and hit completed and now
our Universal I key has been generated
it is now ready to be programmed to the
vehicle like any other FCC ID with
hyq4ea it is that simple guys like I
said the cool thing about these Keys is
that they are reusable you can generate
them as many times as you like so if I
want to back out of this menu and
generate this key to another FCC ID I
can do it no problem even if I program
this key to a vehicle and it becomes
locked to that vehicle let''s say there''s
a problem with the customer maybe the
payment didn''t go through you already
programmed the key and so you want to
take your key back it''s no problem all
you got to do is stick it back in here
and regenerate it and the key will be as
good as new and ready to use on another
vehicle that''s something you cannot do
with OEM keys or even aftermarket Keys
okay guys so just a quick overview of
some of the keys that autel offers in
their Universal format these are some
keys from my personal inventory like I
said I stock all different kinds of keys
for lots of different makes them models
but what I love about these Keys is that
they do offer them in the OEM shell so
here we have one that''s a Nissan style
key now I do have this in the four
button configuration without the remote
start and also the three button
configuration I''m not going to open up
all my keys to show you guys but
basically this here is a universal Smart
Key and can be generated to work with
over 700 different Vehicles using an
autel device like this one now
technically you can generate these
Universal Keys using the im508 however
what I like about the km100 is that it''s
way more portable it''s a lot easier to
use you don''t have to pull out the
separate attachment which is the XP 200
pull the cable out connect it to the
unit in order to generate your Universal
key you can simply just pull out this
unit Slide the key in here of course put
a battery in it first select your
Universal key and then generate it now
the reason I love these keys so much is
that when it comes to inventory and keys
for example let''s say Nissan you might
look at a key for a Nissan Altima and a
Nissan Maxima and the key looks exactly
the same however the FCC IDs of the keys
and the part numbers are actually
different meaning that you couldn''t use
a key from a Nissan Pathfinder on a
Nissan Altima typically they''re going to
be different FCC IDs so rather than
having to inventory one of every FCC ID
that there is for Nissan you can simply
have one key and be able to generate
that key to work with whatever vehicle
you''re programming the key for all you
got to do is look up what fccid is the
correct one for the vehicle I usually do
this by going online and looking through
the catalogs usually uhshardware.com is
a pretty reliable and accurate source
for looking up what type of key your
vehicle needs find the correct FCC ID
for your make and model then find that
FCC ID in the autel generate your key to
that and then program it to the vehicle
that will save you tons of money in
inventory now not only do we have the
Nissan style we also have this Hyundai
style of course these keys do come with
the emergency blade so make sure that
whatever you''re using it for uses the
same emergency blade here we have the
Dodge style this is the five button
configuration I also have the four
button configuration now the other cool
thing about these Keys is that even if
you don''t have the correct button
configuration you can buy the correct
shell for the key that you''re looking
for take the internals out of this key
and move it over to your new shell here
we have the GM style key which is the
Cadillac stock very high quality key
very beautiful indeed a lot of people
have no problem taking this key rather
than some of the older Cadillac keys I
like to sell these as upgrades because
typically those older Cadillac keys they
start to fall apart really easily and
these keys well they''re just better made
then over here we have the Honda style
key this is one of the ones that I sell
more often again people like the style
key and so even for some of the older
style Hondas when I offer them this
newer style they prefer to take this one
again the cool thing about these Keys is
that yes you can change the shell in one
instance I had a customer with a 2021
Acura and they prefer to have the Acura
style key and so basically I generated
and programmed one of these keys and
then I took the internals out of the key
and then I put it into an Acura shell
just to show you guys this is the shell
for the Acura key so there is nothing
inside this key but essentially what you
can do is take the guts out of this key
and it fits right into this key these
shells can be purchased really cheaply
online and are good to have whenever you
have a customer that is a little more
picky and they want the key that looks
like their original key just a quick tip
for you guys also I will add that the
auto Universal I key for the three
button Nissan only comes in this button
configuration which I''m not exactly sure
why because I''ve never seen a Nissan
that has this button Arrangement
typically if it''s a three button this
button down here is going to be a panic
button a lot of the vehicles like the
Nissan Rogues and the Jukes don''t have
an electronic trunk so it''s typically
just a panic button here however it''s no
big deal I still like to buy these
because all I do is I buy the shell for
the three button key that I need all I
got to do is take the internals out of
this key and move it over into the shell
now over here we have the BMW fem style
key which is a very beautiful high
quality key and it is required in order
to generate some of these BMW keys Oops
I did leave out one key which is this
Buick style key this is also a universal
eye key so this can be be generated from
many different Vehicles here at the top
you can see I have a few of these
Universal eye Keys these are the generic
styles that autel offers they do come in
a lot of different button configurations
and I pretty much inventory all of them
now I''m not going to go through and open
every single package to show you guys
you can go online and look at all the
different button configurations that
they offer but just know that these keys
do not come with an emergency blade so
when I pop this open what you''re going
to find is that we have a slot right
here and also a little set screw right
there and what these are designed for is
for you to be able to use Flip Key
blades as emergency blades now I''m going
to be getting a little more into detail
when it comes to flip keys and Flip Key
blades in another video but just know
that yes you can put emergency blades
into these Keys now one key that I am
kind of leaving out is this Ford key
right here this is a very special key
the reason I say that is because this
key is the only key out of all of the
autel keys that you can generate it to
the 900 megahertz frequency now contrary
to some of the things you might read
about these keys and them being able to
work for 900 megahertz it is not true
you cannot generate the 902 megahertz
key for the Ford with any of these other
Universal Keys you have to have this key
now the problem with that is that this
key is kind of elusive I can''t really
find it locally or really anywhere in
the US when I check with my key
suppliers they never seem to have these
available however you can buy these
online from places like AliExpress these
in particular I did get while I was on a
trip to Mexico I was in Mexico City for
the auto mechanical event and one of the
vendors there sold these to me but like
I said guys if you run into the Fords
especially the ones that have remote
start those are typically the higher
frequencies like 902 megahertz you
cannot use any of these keys to generate
that you have to have this key so now
that I''ve shown you guys some of the
available Universal keys for the autel
let''s go ahead and generate one and
program it to a vehicle alright guys so
we''re going to be generating a key and
programming it to a 2022 Nissan Altima
not what I like to start by doing is
going online to a website like
uhshardware.com punching in the make and
model of the vehicle that we''re going to
be programming a key to and finding the
correct FCC ID for the key we need to
generate so on the tool we''re going to
start by going to Universal key we''re
going to select Nissan
for the model we''re going to select
Ultima for the year we''re going to
select 2022. again the important thing
is that we find the correct FCC ID and
also the button configuration now this
vehicle originally does come with remote
start however the customer bought this
vehicle from a used car lot and the key
that they gave him was a key without
remote start so obviously at some point
in time they had lost the keys and
whoever sold them the keys sold them a
key without remote start now the key
still functions and everything however
the customer does want the remote start
function because of course his car comes
equipped with it now I did already
successfully add a key to this one the
remote start works great however the
customer did call me back because now he
wants a second key so that''s what we''re
going to be doing today so we''re going
to scroll through these FCC IDs and
we''re going to locate the five button
remote start key that has fccid
kr5tx N4 there''s our key right there as
you can see it is the five button with
the remote start and so before we can
generate this key we are going to have
to put a battery in it again these
Universal keys do not come with
batteries so you do have to buy them
separately in this case they use a
CR2032 battery so we''re basically just
going to take this part of the shell
we''re going to pop in the battery then
we''re going to take the other half of
the shell and then we''re going to put it
together line it up correctly
then just pop it back together
now our key has a battery in it and it''s
ready to generate so we''ll go ahead and
drop it into the slot and hit generate
Universal key
as you can see it''s generating our key
this should only take about a minute or
so
key generation is completed and now our
key is ready to program to the vehicle
okay guys so 2022 Nissan Altima again
I''ve got the km100 right here you can
see I''ve already got the Bluetooth
dongle connected and over here on the
center console I''ve got three keys now
this one here is the original Nissan key
that''s already programmed to the vehicle
and this one is an oxtail generated ikey
that I already programmed everything
works great and this is the key here
that we''re going to be adding now the
way we''re going to do this today is
we''re going to do an all keys lost
situation that way we can erase all of
the previous keys that were in the
memory that no longer is with the
vehicle and so basically we''re going to
be starting fresh we''re going to go
ahead and start by going into emo
then we''re going to select Nissan
Right Here Nissan
let''s just go ahead and do automatic
selection
it''s telling us to turn the hazard
lights on so we''ll go ahead and hit the
hazard switch the hazard lights are now
on and it wants us to open and close the
door I''m going to go ahead and hit OK
it''s scanning the vehicle system okay so
I''m going to go into IMO status scan and
here it''s going to scan the modules and
if you look there are no dtc''s present
in the BCM so we''re going to go ahead
and do all keys lost guided I''m gonna go
ahead and shut the vehicle off
our hazard lights are still on and we''re
going to go ahead and hit start and it''s
going to obtain the pin number it tells
us execution of this function will erase
all keys so make sure you have all the
keys that you need to learn to the
vehicle ready we do so we''re going to
click yes turn the ignition off turn on
the hazard lights and open and close the
door we already did that so we''ll hit ok
now here it''s giving us a little warning
this is our BCM code that it pulled up
and it''s letting us know that if we have
one of these other BCM codes then
attempting this programming may be risky
some of these bcms can actually lock up
or become bricked just by doing the PIN
code reading and so you need to make
sure that your VIN number is not part of
this Blacklist now if you guys didn''t
know you could go online and Google
Nissan BCM Blacklist you''re going to
find a set of numbers and those are
going to be the bco numbers you want to
stay away from again our number here
does not match any of the ones on The
Blacklist so we''re going to go ahead and
click yes
now it''s telling us to place the
original smart key up against the button
so this here is our original I key I''m
going to put it up against the button
just in case you guys didn''t know our
ignition button is right here make sure
you have it where the emblem is right
where the button is we''re going to go
ahead and click OK establishing
communication okay so success it pulled
the PIN code now it''s telling us to push
the ignition switch and put the key that
you want to learn up against the button
so I''m going to push it
and you can see the instrument cluster
just came on and if you pay attention
the security light went off that is a
good sign so we''re going to go ahead and
hit OK turn off the ignition so let''s
push it again
ignition is off now we''ll hit OK program
success continue to program the next one
yes we''re basically going to do the same
thing with the next key so I''m going to
put the next key up against the push
button then we''re going to push it once
the instrument cluster comes on and pay
attention to that security light you see
how it went away that means our key is
now registered so we''re going to hit OK
it says turn the ignition off so we''ll
turn it off instrument cluster is now
off and then we''re going to hit OK
program success continue to the next one
yes now we''re basically going to do the
same thing with our final key this one
here put it up against the start button
and we''re going to push it
push it once instrument cluster should
light up
and pay attention to that security light
right there
it just went away and so we''re going to
hit OK
it says turn the ignition off
ignition is now off and we''ll hit OK
programming success continue to the next
one no now it''s telling us to put the
first key that was learned up against
the button that''s going to be this
original Nissan key so we''ll put it up
against the button and we''re going to
push it once
the instrument cluster should light up
instrument cluster came on so we''ll hit
ok now it says turn it off and wait for
three seconds so we''re gonna count to
three and you can see we already have a
message here key registration complete
and so now we should be ready to hit OK
programming complete check if remote
control is operating properly start the
engine and wait for five seconds so I''m
going to hit OK
and we should be done here with the tool
yep so we have success there all the way
around now I''m going to go ahead and
shut the hazard lights off then I''m
going to open and close the door then
we''re going to check to see if our
remotes work so we''ll start with the
original one lock
unlock that works we''ll go ahead and try
the second one so lock
and unlock
that works
and then we''ll try the third one lock
unlock now let''s go ahead and try to
start the vehicle so foot on the brake
pedal hit the start button
and car starts up right away and just
like that we''re done all right guys so
before we end off the video a couple
things I wanted to mention about the
tool number one is that this thing
actually comes with the built-in apb112
if you guys aren''t familiar with that
basically what it is is a key simulator
and it can be used in order to do an all
keys lost situation on a newer Toyota
now the apb112 is an item that has to be
purchased separately if you guys have
either an im508 or the im506 they do not
come with the tools when you buy them
and the simulator is usually somewhere
between two and three hundred dollars
now the simulator is really useful if
you run into an all keys lost situation
on a newer Toyota the newer Toyotas
require a 12-digit rolling pin code and
so what you can do on some of these is
actually read the eprom information by
OBD using the tool then with that eprom
information this thing can actually
simulate the key that was programmed to
the vehicle so you can actually start
the vehicle with the antenna on this
this also allows you to add a key easily
on these newer Toyotas by simulating the
original key and then using that to add
the second key so really cool feature to
have built into the tool like I said if
you guys have an im508 or an im608 it
does not come with it you have to buy
the apb112 separately with this km100
it''s built into the tool now second
thing I wanted to mention if you guys
are buying this tool in order to do
cloning by that I mean cloning of
transponders let it be known that the
vvdi Superchip from xhorse does not work
with this tool I know a lot of guys get
confused because that''s really the most
popular chip that''s on the market
however the vvdi Superchip does not work
with the auto now as far as what chips
do work with the odd cell I''m not
exactly sure though I have seen several
videos of people actually cloning chips
with this tool so I know that there are
some chips on the market that do work
with the autel I''m just not exactly sure
which ones other than that this tool is
one of my top five favorite tools that I
have in my possession this is easily the
first key programmer that I go for
anytime I go to program Keys simply
because it''s so portable and easy to use
now will it do everything no but it does
do probably 90 of the vehicles that I
program keys for and for for the rest
that this thing can''t do I have several
other tools for that and all those other
tools are a lot more expensive than this
one now if you guys are interested in
purchasing this product I will leave a
link down in the description below I do
want to let you guys know that I was not
paid to review this product I''m simply

hello and welcome back to gears and tech
today we''re sitting in our brand new
ford mustang i want to talk about keys
when we bought this car it had just this
one key now this key is a key fob it has
door unlock lock and also panic and a
trunk release the trunk release does not
work on this key plus i don''t like
having only one key for my car i have
purchased this key which is a factory
replacement from amazon i''ll put a link
in the description where you can get
this key what i''m about to show you will
work on any car pretty much from about
and older
this particular key it comes uncut it''s
currently cut now and that''s because i
took it to my local hardware store and
just said can you please cut this key
they should do that for you now in
canada i''ve had the most success going
to home hardware home hardware still has
the old machine where it clamps it in
and then it traces the key out if it is
a newer machine where they just stick it
in like what a walmart has they may not
cut the key for you that''s because they
will check if it has a chip and if it
does they will not cut it because they
say that that can damage the chip the
vibration and it can
i have programmed hundreds of keys and i
have seen damaged chips now that the key
is cut and i can use it in the ignition
i will show you what happens with a
proper key and this cut key this is the
regular key so i''m going to stick it in
and on the dash here the key lock
indicator showing so when i stick it in
it''ll blink once
and the car will fire right up no issue
now i''m going to take this key out i''m
going to take this
cut key
the reason that that''s blinking before
we get too far into this video don''t
forget to subscribe to the channel down
below if you''ve seen some of our content
already and have not subscribed we want
you to join our community smash that
like button hit subscribe and let''s get
back to the video the reason that that''s
blinking is because this key has not
been programmed so we need to program it
so i know you''re wondering what we''re
going to use to program it it''s not
super easy we are going to use special
hardware this hardware is available
again on amazon it is very inexpensive
it''s actually cheaper
to buy the key from amazon and this
programmer than it is to pay somebody to
provide you the key cut it and program
it so you can do this once and have this
forever this is the ck 100 programmer it
plugs into your standard obd2 port and
it will program
hundreds of different keys with
different manufacturers it will program
this ford mustang it programs most fords
most chevys most pontiacs all that the
first thing we need to do is plug in the
obd2 connector so it''s going to be
underneath here
plug it in make sure it''s good and snug
it will immediately power on first thing
we''re going to be greeted with is the
serial number and the last update is
from 2014 this is kind of old i''m going
to press f1 to continue now once in a
minute my main menu i''m going to go to
immobilizer i''m going to press enter and
then we''re going to just pick our
vehicle i''m going to press this button
it tabs through the pages we''re going to
go until we see f ford and we want ford
usa enter
now it''s going to ask what kind of ford
is this
mustang this particular mustang is a
2010-2012
enter
now it''s going to say pressing a key
i''m going to press any key now it says
insert a key and turn on the console i''m
going to take
my new key
and i''m going to stick it in
like that and i''m going to turn it on to
position two
then i''m going to hit enter
and it''s going to say please wait
connecting there we go now it''s going to
say what do you want to do program new
keys
present errors or errors reset now if i
go present errors it''s probably going to
give me an error for unknown key so
detected one errors
and it''s pat''s key failure that''s okay
because i know
that i tried to use an unprogrammed key
in here so i''m going to reset that
delete errors yes terminated
escape there we go now i want to program
new keys and we can go erase all keys i
do not recommend erasing all keys the
reason i say not to erase all keys is
because
this key still works i have
erased all keys before and then had a
heck of a time trying to program a new
key if you erase all keys this key will
also stop working i can go number of
keys in memory so i can push that it
will connect and then it''ll say there is
two keys in memory and again
i have one key so somewhere out there is
a ford key that will work on this car
and i don''t know who has that key
but that''s okay so i''m going to go to
add a key
and press enter and it''s going to say
add a key insert the new key
turn ignition on so i still have the key
in
and it is still on this is the new key
this right here is the old key
now i''m going to press enter
and it''s going to say safety access
procedure elapsed time
2 of max 800 seconds 800 seconds is
about 13 and a half minutes the reason
is it is a safety lockout procedure if
somebody had gotten a hold of one of
these tools
and if they somehow figured out what
your key code was and created a new key
for your car
based on that key code for example right
now somebody''s looking at this key and
they know exactly what the key code is
for this key that''s because each
individual cut at each specific location
is actually coded to a specific number
to where somebody could
make this key just from having a picture
of this key if
they got a picture of the key made a key
knew where my car was found my car came
to my car and brought this tool with
them they would have to sit in my
driveway for 13 and a half minutes doing
exactly what i''m doing right now just to
program the key so they could steal my
car this is more of a deterrent system
than anything
most auto manufacturers have some sort
of a lockout now depending on the
programmer that you have it may have a
lockout bypass and that''s what that
would mean when you''re looking at
different programmers and options that
they have this particular one does not
have a lockout bypass in the sense that
it will not bypass the timer but usually
around
seconds
the safety access procedure will be
complete and it will unlock the car and
allow it to accept the new
key chevy does this as well what dodge
does is they have a safety code and
access code and this programmer asks you
for that access code if you are
programming a different car and it''s
asking you for that safety access code
sometimes you can call your dealership
and they will give it to you over the
phone or you have to come in and prove
that you own the vehicle before they
will give you that access code it is
your car it is your code you own that
code the dealership has an obligation to
release that code to you other
manufacturers like nissan has a access
code as well mitsubishi does a lot of
those manufacturers have access codes
rather than a timeout the ford
has just a timeout procedure no code is
required i''m going to sit here i will
show you when it''s done and what it
looks like here we are just over halfway
through 500 seconds of 800. it is very
important that you do not play with this
or
with your key
while this procedure is taking place i
have seen this procedure fail before i
have sat for the 13 and a half minutes
and at 13.3
minutes
it has failed and i''ve had to redo it
now it will fail for a number of reasons
sometimes it just fails it''s just a fact
of life and trying again is what''s
required to make it work sometimes it
fails because the chip isn''t working
sometimes it fails because you picked
the wrong vehicle sometimes it fails
because something''s wrong with the
vehicle sometimes it fails because the
battery died keep in mind we''ve got the
ignition on right now my battery
indicator there is on saying hey start
your car your battery''s gonna die we''re
you know taking some risks here plus
keep in mind this is just a chinese
knockoff piece of equipment it is not
manufactured spec equipment it timed out
and it says the key has been stored
press any key so i''m going to press the
any key that''s this one right here says
and it says do you want to save customer
data i always say no it doesn''t matter
and then takes us back to this
now let''s shut the key off we''re going
to cycle this this is the cut key last
time when we stuck it in we got the
lockout battery thing here so i''m going
to try and start
it and there we go
the car is now running with that key
i still have the original key here which
will make sure it works still take this
one out this is the brand new key we''ll
put it up there where we can see it this
is the original key i always make sure
that the original key still works
just like that just to be sure
you need to understand that in this case
it does not program this part of the fob
these buttons
still do not work that''s okay because
there is a separate procedure for
programming those buttons this key will
open the door and it will start the car
which is what we wanted to do we are
finished with this programmer so i can
unplug it
and we can set that aside over here what
i want to do is program these buttons
for the key fob and the way you''re going
to do that is take the original key you
want to stick this in here recycle it on
and off eight times we''re gonna leave it
on on the eighth time because this is a
dual headed key and it can go either way
you want to do it this way so that when
it''s on the buttons are accessible and
that''ll be important in a minute so here
we go one two three
four five
six seven eight
okay now that it locked and you''ve put
it into program mode like that
the horn honks and then we push this
you can hear the doors lock
and that has programmed this key fob and
this one should still works
and this is the new one
so if you follow these steps you can
program your ford key or pretty much any
other manufacturer there''s a long list
of manufacturers that this programmer
works with so far i have found that
compatibility is actually quite high and
this is one of the most cost effective
programmers that you can get this one
the trunk popper wasn''t working on
and if i push it it just it just never
worked
but
now this one
there you go
so you can see that works perfectly now

going to show you how to perform in all
keys lost for a newer Ford this is a
2018 Ford F-150 says smart key I''m going
to show you how to do the all keys lost
on the autel
im508 now I''m going to go ahead and get
to my Ford and load my vehicle info one
thing I would strongly recommend
is do not do all keys lost unless you
absolutely have to uh you can even if
you''ve lost all the keys you can just do
add a key uh the reason I''m doing this
is we''ve u reflashed a computer did a
parameter reset so we''re going to go
ahead and do the all keys lost to
recognize the keys I''m adding
three one right here one right here and
a second here or a third here uh other
thing you want to take note of is where
the learning slot is for the smart key
on this vehicle we are looking at our
cup holder
you''ll remove the little grommet there
and you''ll see a little insert for the
key to go we can go ahead and take one
key place it in there like so and we''ll
get started with our ignition on we''re
going to go ahead and automatically read
the
VIN we''ll select smart key
from here I''m going to go to control
unit keyless system key
learning now I''m going to go ahead and
select all smart Keys lost we will need
internet and it''s telling us it''s normal
for the instrument cluster to black out
and that it''s going to delete the keys
so once we know that that''s all going to
happen we''ll select
yes and we''ll see what entails sometimes
you get a 10 minute wait for security
access we do not have an active alarm so
we''ll select
no so now what we''re having here is the
nav screen has went out our cluster has
shut off that is completely normal
usually when I do this that it works but
what I''m going to do is go ahead and
pause the video until we get to our next
screen just so it doesn''t take up 10
minutes of uh the same screen here so uh
I''ll be back once it go ahead once it
configures a system and and we''ll move
on okay we''re about 3 or 4 minutes in
our nav screen has come back our gauge
cluster is on got some warning lights
see if I can show you here between the
steering wheel Hill start not assist
that stuff''s normal to see it''s just a
lack of communication with the
BCM and those lights will go away so
what it''s saying here is we''re going to
have to have two keys for clearing Keys
going to go ahead and hit yes
that''s how many keys we have learned to
the vehicle it''s going to erase
them now we have zero keys so we''ve got
our keys still in the learning
pocket insert key to be
learned we''re going to hit okay and
we''ll hear the door lock cycle
so there''s our first
one go ahead and put that away going to
take our second
one hit
yes new key is in the
slot all right so we''ve got our second
key in the car should be good to to
start let''s go ahead and add this third
key if I''m not mistaken this key has a
dead battery so there''s a chance we
might have to open it up for it to get
some signal there I''ve had that happen a
lot so we''ll go to the third one through
our
menus we''ll see if it fails on this one
nope all right there we have it we''ve
got three keys learn to the vehicle
now see if we can get that lock cycling
try all
three and we''re going to go ahead and
hit no on the autel let it close
out let''s see if she
starts and you''ll notice those error
lights about the hill assist have went
away so
there you have it guys that''s how you do
an all keys lost with your autel im508
on the new or Fords it''s a 2018 F-150

what''s going on guys welcome back to the
channel
today we have this 2017
uh it''s a ford f-150 and today we''re
going to program a new key for this
truck so as you can see here i have
the original key
i''m going to use the
key that i want to program we already
actually cut this key
and
let me just show you that it doesn''t
turn on the truck
so
what we''re gonna use today to program
these two keys
um
we''re gonna use the autel uh 608
so here we have the information already
pre-selected on this truck and now i''m
gonna take you we actually are gonna
need the first original key
to open the switch
we are going to
scan the immobilizer to see how many
keys we have programmed because you can
program uh only up to eight
and we should see only like four or two
already programmed so we have two
from the factory
uh we''re gonna add a key
we''re gonna select key guided automatic
we''re gonna
start and it''s gonna say if the factor
alarm is activated you need to
deactivate it first so
we don''t have that activated so we''re
getting uh press yes
and select yes
it is normal that the instrument cluster
is gonna flash sometimes because of the
programming function so we press insert
the key to be learned and turn the
ignition on so we''re gonna remove the
key
and we''re gonna insert the key we want
to
learn
we''re gonna press okay
it''s gonna enter the system and it''s
gonna require about three to ten minutes
sometimes it takes less time but
let''s just wait in and see what happens
okay so that was quicker than i thought
it took only a minute so we''re going to
press ok
turn ignition off
we''re going to press ok again
insert the key to mid learn and turn
ignition on
press ok learning key
and we successfully learned the key as
you heard the the log cycle and that
means the key is already programmed so
we don''t want to program another key
we
we''re gonna go back escape
and now we''re gonna test the key
so we see here it''s working
and now let''s go i''m gonna test the
other one
so both keys work
now
let''s rescan the system make sure we
have the key already programmed so we''re
gonna do a mobilizer scan again
and let''s just wait let''s just wait for
codes probably i''m gonna have full court
no
we''re good uh and now we have three keys
already programmed all right so this is
pretty much how you do it it''s really
simple with this tool uh with other
tools takes like 10 minutes but with
this one
it''s an amazing amazing tool a little
bit pricey but it''s worth
buying this tool because you can do so
much work with this all right guys so i

Silverado,

you didn''t need to plug in. You could do
some onboard programming. With newer
ones, you
cannot. We have the smart card, which is
up here. I don''t know how much of this
you guys can see, but we''re going to
just try it and find out. So, we hit
enter after we switch ignition on
So, you hold both buttons down for up to
8 seconds. You hear the beep, that means
it''s done. Hit
enter. And that''s it. We''re
done. Turn it
off. Open the door up.

serious topic
the future
hello this is hof the hoff hoffman here
with our auto pro pad g2 turbo
today we''re working on a 2018 chevy
silverado we''re gonna be adding a new
key to it
as you can see theflight is on this key
is not programmed
we do have one existing key however in
this case we''re going to clear all keys
in order to just have these two
programmed
to start we need to read the pin code go
to mobilization

read security code bcm read pin code
yes we do want to read the pin must be

this will pop up once more to read the
pin code in a second
read pin code
2049 is our pin
now back out of here

2017 plus program keys without smart
all keys lost i''m going to turn this off
and on again
another pin two zero four
nine
password is two zero four nine
and we''ll be back in about ten minutes
and we''re back here about nine and a
half minutes down a few more seconds
left
the fight''s still on
all right so it has been 10 minutes the
flight is out
insert the key you wish to program from
the ignition on position then press ok
yes we do want to program another key
because this is a two key system
yes commission off
press okay next key to be programmed
off remove key press okay
you do not want to program another key
ignition off
remove key
now sometimes when doing this the theft
light will stay on even if the keys are
quick workaround on that is to go back
and pull the pin code again
in doing so that will clear the fault
codes but we''ll see if that happens on
this one

this is the
key that works
all right so
let''s go ahead and get on this auto pro
pad
make sure you get the hazard lights on
before you get started
that way it can actually uh
find the car on the auto detect
automatically identify
now if this doesn''t go through on
automatic you can just actually just go
manually
and get it done that way
as you see here it says 22 ram
see us
talks about the secret security gateway
plug
all right so i''m going to read the pin
it takes just a little bit
all right there it is four eight one two
four all right
all right
i''m gonna go ahead and read the number
of keys in the system there''s two so
that''s what i like to do i like to see
what number how many keys are in the
system before i get started so that way
if it fails i can actually just go back
and see if the key actually learned so
let me press ok i''m going to go to
program key
48124 it''s already populated
all right hold down the start button on
the upper corner of the key
so i''m gonna go ahead and look for it
there
press the button
i''m just going to hold it down
c
let me see something real quick
let me go ahead and take out the actual
original key
because it doesn''t look like it''s going
through
let''s take this original key out of the
car and that way it''s not being seen by
that put it back here
the back of the bed normally i like to
keep them outside but i kind of forgot
and then let''s start that over again
here we go
press it
that still will still be able to be seen
by the other the other key give me one
second
get a little further out
hopefully that''ll work
all right let''s start that over again
and let''s press one more time here we go
two
i''m not getting anything on this key
[Music]
i''m not getting the thing here
it''s not seeing the foam at all
okay
maybe this one didn''t go through give me
one sec we''re going to start this over
again
all right guys we''re back on this 22 uh
dodge ram and uh
obviously earlier we were trying to get
it to go
and it wasn''t going so
what i ended up doing is i ended up like
reading the chip value or specific chip
value and it was off like
at least with the little the the mini
key tool
it came up as a
7953 mary
and the key i was trying to add in was a
7939 mary
which you know is different so
um i did find
uh another key that uh
had the 7953 mary and we''re gonna go
with that um but the cool thing like i
said before like cool thing about this
is that we''re
seeing that the auto pro pad is able to
communicate is able to read the pin
uh to see how many keys are in and it
wasn''t the auto pro pad''s fault that the
key wasn''t being added
clearly it was because
the chip value is different you know so
here we''re going to figure it we''re
going to show you guys how to get it all
done
remember i like to write obviously see
the number of keys it says 2
and now we''re going to go into program
key
yep
all right so it''s going to tell me to
put the key to the start button and hold
it down
we''ll do that now
let''s see what that says
and program success
all right guys we''re done now we''re
gonna go see the number of keys
says three
all right so this key
definitely works
awesome all right guys so i just wanted
to show you guys that

now the first thing you need to do is
make sure you have a master key
in order to do that look around find the
blinking red light in this 2018 camry
it''s right here
it can be anywhere on the dashboard
sometimes it can be up above it can even

confirm you have a master key
as we slide this in the ignition
watch the blinking red light it''s going

so
once we''ve confirmed that
we''re going to take tom''s car key
programmer it''s got key and remote
settings
we''ll turn it to the key setting
it''s important for you to know there''s
two things you have to do to program a
key one is program the chip
to release the immobilizer which will
let the engine start otherwise it
immobilizes the vehicle
the second thing you have to do is the
remote portion
so that the remote buttons will work
and
unlock the car lock the car that kind of
thing we''re going to do the key first

program you''re going to take your new
key
this is uncut notice it''s uncut
take out the working key put this in in
the ignition don''t push too hard but
just as hard just until it stays in
there
you''ll see this start blinking now we''ve
got to wait 60 seconds
watch the blinking pattern it should be
a steady on off
if there''s a different pattern like too
quick a pause and then three quick
it means there''s a something else you''ll
want to email help at tom''s key you''ll
know the key is programmed when this red
light stops blinking
okay it''s getting close
there it stopped blinking
this key is now programmed to this
vehicle so once you get it cut it''ll
start the engine you can check that it''s
programmed and disconnect the programmer
by sliding it into the ignition
notice the red light went off
pull it out the red light''s blinking
again
again be careful because this isn''t cut
you don''t want to push it too hard
just enough that it''ll slip in and stay
you kind of feel it latch into place

remote buttons so they don''t work right

Hey, what''s up? How''s everybody doing?
Welcome to my channel, Mike''s
Automotive. So, today we''re working with
the Honda Civic, you guys. And this is
like 2016 and up for push to start. Now,
the customer had a auto universal remote
pro into the vehicle.
And the thing is that it was kind of
working. It turns on the car when it
wants to. It doesn''t turn on. Sometimes
it does. So, she''s like, "Hey, I''m just
going to get an OEM smart key and just
go ahead and program it." So, I said,
"All right." So, we''re going to be using
our auto. Go ahead and make sure you
have your uh emergency lights on if you
can''t turn it on. If you can turn it on,
turn it on. Okay. Now, um we''re going to
go to automatic uh VIN scan. So, it''s
going to automatically search for the
vehicle using the VIN. Um like I said,
if you can turn it on, turn it on. We''re
going to select smart key.
We''re going to do a push to start. Okay?
Because it''s push to start.
Um, as you guys can see, there''s
information right there for Civic.
Um, we''re going to We always go through
MMO status scan just because it it does
the the scan of the MMO system and it
lets us know something''s wrong with it
um or anything. So, it says is ignition
turned on by pressing the start button.
If you can turn it on, yes. If you can
press no.
So, um, we''re going to go ahead and scan
it. You guys can see it has the smart
system on here and then the immo system.
So, the smart system would be like
anything that''s keyless, any modules
that are that can pick it up, you know,
the immo system, of course, is the
immobilizer system that immobilizes a
vehicle if it''s not the correct key. So,
um, we''re going to go through all keys
lost. Actually, if you have a key, you
can go through add a key, but I''m going
to go through all keys lost because at
the end of the day, their key didn''t
want to turn on the car and off when it
needed to. And this requires you to turn
on and off the car. So, it says to place
the key to be learned in the vehicle and
take all the other keys out.
Is the ignition turned on by pressing
on? Um, no. We can''t turn it on. So,
we''re going to press no. It says press
and hold the start button. So, we''re
going to press and hold the start button
until the until the ignition uh turns on
and the cluster turns on and all the
lights, everything kind of like
accessory mode.
Um, is ignition switched on? Please
release the ignition. We''re going to
press okay.
Okay, here''s the next step. whether it''s
a newer model generally refers to after
2020. We''re going to press no because
it''s not over 2020. It''s like 16 through
18.
Now it''s establish establishing vehicle
communication.
Okay. Checking condition of the vehicle.
Please wait.
Keep program success. Would you like to
program the next one?
Press yes if you have another one. Press
no if you don''t have another one. So
it''s telling us to press the start
button.
Okay, to turn it off.
Now it says to turn it on. So basically
for all Honda, this is how it is. Turn
it off. Turn it on.
So you might have to um
Okay. Are both the keys
keyless? Is indicator immobilizer light
off? Yes, it''s off. We''re going to press
yes. Now again, it''s going to tell us to
shut it off. So, we''re going to press
it.
Now, it says to turn it on. Okay. Now,
now you''re going to have to press it
twice to turn it on every time you press
it. So, press it twice to turn it off
and once, excuse me, press it twice to
turn it on and once to turn it off. As
you guys can see, the registration is
complete. Okay, turn it off. Press it
once to turn it off. Now, don''t put your
foot on the brake, okay? Like, do not
start the actual vehicle. It just wants
you to put it in accessory mode. As you
guys can see, excuse me, it''s
programmed. The remote works. Everything
works perfectly. Um, please don''t forget

how you can make a spare key for your
vehicle check this out I''m Mike with
Tom''s key company we''ve got one fob for
this 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee we''re
going to make a spare key come to
tomskey.com where you can place your
order to get a programmer spare key sent
to you today it''s important for you to
know you''ve got to have at least one
working key fob for your vehicle in
order for Tom''s key company to help you
make a spare for your vehicle watch how
easy this is okay to get started we''ve
got one working key for this 2015 Jeep
Grand Cherokee and have a spare key here
the original is an oem with a Jeep logo
spare is an aftermarket which works just
great
so during programming you''re going to
have to have your key fobs far enough
away from the vehicle so the only one
key is detected
so to do that you get out of the vehicle
and go find and set these uh inside the
house the other side of the garage make
sure they''re far enough away
[Music]
and try and start the engine
it doesn''t want to start
it''s giving us an error
it can''t detect the keys we can bring
the keys in one at a time
now we know where to set the keys so
they''re far enough away that we can
program the new one
and here''s the programming device first
thing you need to do is use your phone
scan download the app
with the app installed let''s start
programming
going to come into key pairing here
first you need to scan the QR code on
this device it''ll help it as it pairs
with your VIN number
make sure you get the QR Code by the
serial number right there
okay it warns you you need the internet
connection got to have all the keys that
you plan to pair as well as your
original keys and repairing tools so
let''s get going
to come in and select our vehicle 2015
Jeep Grand Cherokee and it asks if that
looks like my original key yep
that key does look the same
okay we need to download a file for Jeep
let''s get that going
now while we''re waiting I''ll let you
know the app will get better over time
so some of the steps may be a little bit
different when you perform the
programming process for your vehicle
so follow the instructions on the app it
should walk you through step by step
nice and easy
okay our Jeep data is installed
all right we''ve got to plug our
programmer into the OBD Port that''s down
near the gas and brake pedal
come down here you''re gonna have to look
around to find the port
that it fits into and plug it in
now you''ll see it light up it''s a little
hard to see the light
so I''m going to use this extension cable
you can pick one of those up to make
your life a little bit easier
all right I''ve got this guy plugged in
and let''s go ahead and hit next see the
green light
okay we''re going to scan for the
Bluetooth
okay the phone pulls up I see the same
serial number there and it''s 284 so
let''s try and pair it
should get a pairing request yep
okay
we''re connected we saw light turn blue
it''s connected now it''s scanning it''s
checking to make sure it''s got the
current firmware in this device you may
find that the light turns red and it has
to update that''s okay perfectly normal
all right there it''s detected the new
version so it''s disconnected
light went green blue we should turn it
red okay now it''s updating the firmware
great successful
we got to get this thing paired again
it''s trying there
we''re reconnected okay
hit next
all right we''re up to date so
we''re back out
may need to start the app over at this
point depending on your vehicle and
depending on how the update
took place
okay this one we don''t need to count
down turn on the ignition within 30
seconds
pushed it twice
saw the lights flash up it shows run
right here
okay we''re going to take the original
key in the vehicle start the vehicle
here''s my original working key with the
tile key finder you can pick one of
those up as well
pairs to your smartphone so you never
lose your keys
let''s start the engine
push the brake engine started
put next
checking the vehicle status
communication going on here
now this device pairs with the VIN for
your vehicle so you can use it to make
multiple keys but you can''t use it on
additional vehicles
turn off the ignition
okay ignition''s turned off
turn on the ignition without depressing
the brake pedal okay
I''m gonna click it twice
everything light up
all right give some important
information key pairing will not cause
existing keys to be erased up to eight
keys can be paired to the vehicle this
vehicle currently has two so somewhere
in the world prior car dealership or
prior owner somebody lost a key and we
only have one for the vehicle right now
so we''re going to program one key by the
time we''re done that should go from two
to three keys
there''s a new one we''re going to pair
okay I turn the ignition off
all right turn on the hazards okay
hazards are flashing communicating
it''s going to take up to 10 minutes here
now I will say if it''s a hot day you can
roll down your windows before you start
this process you don''t want to be
getting in and out of the vehicle while
the programming''s going on
while we wait a quick reminder keep
watching to see the magic of our key by
photo service
okay we''re almost done there we go we''ve
reached 100 okay remove all smart
devices and paired keys from the vehicle
place the first key to be paired close
to the center console all right so I''ve

today we''re going to take a look at how
to replace the battery in this Jeep
remote key fob
this cheap key fob is going to use
replacement battery
CR2032 and I''ll put a link in the
description box of this video to where
you can purchase these batteries if
you''re in need
the other thing I''m going to be using to
do this is a flathead screwdriver
the first thing I''m going to do is
remove the emergency key that''s in the
bottom of the key fob
that''s done by pressing this release on
the back of the key fob
hold that release down
and then the emergency key will slide
out like that
we can just set that to the side
now if we grab our screwdriver and we
hold the key fob with the buttons facing
down and then we take a look at the
bottom of it
this is the slot that that emergency key
slid out of just below that we see this
Notch right here
what I''m going to do is put my
screwdriver in that Notch push it in as
far as it will go and then I''m going to
twist the screwdriver like I''m opening a
lock with a key
and as I do that it splits the two
halves of the shell apart like that
go ahead and pull them the rest of the
way apart
and in the back half of the shell we see
our battery right here
then I''m going to grab my screwdriver
again and in this plastic holder there''s
a little cutout you can see right there
that''ll allow you to get under the edge
of the battery
and get it out of that holder
then I''m going to grab the new battery
and we want to make sure that we''re
installing that with the plus side down
like that
and you can see in this holder there''s
this little metal piece right here
that''s the edge we''re going to tuck in
first like that so tuck that edge in
first
and then snap it the rest of the way
down
and then we can put the two halves of
the shell back together
make sure it''s all the way back together
Slide the emergency key back in
and that''s it

appreciate it

after it finished uh um let''s do the
decoding again because it wasn''t sitting
on the right direction as you can see
I''m adjus in my uh my belt over
there the two um the two sides of the
key have different cuts so is going to
read like each side
differently and um and then we can cut
the
key what I want to make sure that after
that I uh decoded I want to make sure
that all the numbers on this screen are
blue if they are red that means they are
not good over here I can see that some
of them are not good so I''m going to

going to show you how to program a smart
key without needing a PIN code for this
2020 Toyota Corolla we''ve got our
working key right here
and then key that needs to be programmed
we''re using the autel im508 we''re going
to start out by going to the immobilizer
menu
where we will select our vehicle
go to Toyota
go ahead and
turn on the ignition
[Music]
get automatic selection
see what that comes up with
all right so there''s our Vin hit okay
2020 Corolla
all right guys so you''re going to want
to make sure that you got
good battery
level top right corner but this is what
we''re going to do we''re going to go do
control unit keyless system
first step is going to be to back up
immobilizer data via OBD
so turn off ignition
turn on hazards
all right so
we''ll hit okay
I''m gonna back up the
prom data
you notice it says that this allows us
to do immobilizer functions without pin
I''m going to show you how that''s done
this might take a moment
now I mentioned that about the battery
level because I''ve done this before on
some Toyotas with
usually less than 11 volts or they''re
pretty low and it''ll start throwing
codes make the computer freak out if you
clear the codes everything''s good to go
but just be mindful of that
okay so where''s our eprom file
going to go to
there hit save
so now we got the immobilizer data
backed up we''re going to back out and go
to add smart key
only four keys can be learned
is on
I''m going to go ahead and hit OK
ignition off
so it says number of Keys has reach the
max let''s see how many are in here four
so this is what we''re gonna do now you
got to be very careful doing this
because you can
delete keys
and then
you can''t get them back in there
so we''ll go to erase keys
notice it says that the key is not close
to the start button will be cleared
cannot be learned again so here''s our
learned key we do not want that deleted
turn on ignition turn on the hazard turn
off the hazards
ignition is on
guys I really want to show this step
here because you can screw this up
turn off the ignition turn on hazards
we have backed up the eprom data
foreign
so it''s our bin 20.
now it''s going to use this pin to
erase the keys take our key that we want
to be working
put it near buzzer
buzzer will beep it has beeped once
so that key is going to be learned back
into the car
any others the other three are no longer
going to work
in addition to not working
you will not be able to reprogram them
into another vehicle
so don''t learn that the hard way make
sure you have them all ready to go in
your hands
so now we got one key
see if it still works
I''m gonna close this door
stop that beeping
all right so we''re still good that key
still functions that''s what we want to
see let''s go back to add smart key
maximum four can be learned
let''s get some Focus back in on that
all right okay
there''s our van
please check yes that''s our bin
turn ignition off
hazard lights on
okay
yes we have backed up the eprom data so
that first step I showed you in the
beginning
this is how you get by this is how you
get past the PIN code
so
be mindful you don''t have to pay for PIN
codes on these
so there it is reading pin
key programmed key
close to the start button
it''s this guy right here
little beep once
beep twice
so we''re gonna let it time out here
should tell us to turn on the ignition
and put the key back up to the button
one more time
so let''s go ahead and do that
put learn key close to start button
it''s our new one
you heard that beep learning succeeded
so if everything was done correctly
let''s make sure they work
this is our new key
let''s check our old one
and we''ll fire it up see when it
when you unlock the vehicle that padlock
goes away
so we''ll put our foot on the brake
make sure she fires up
those look like some programmed keys I
hope that helps guys remember don''t pay
for your PIN codes on this newer Toyota
system smart key let''s back up your
mobilizer data get the PIN code that way
remember that you do have a maximum of
four keys and if you''re gonna delete
Keys these cannot be reprogrammed or
refurbished so I recommend OEM new only

process on all the models this is how
it''s going to go um basically what i''m
going to do is these are the remotes
that came with the car i''m going to be
adding this as a third because i''m going

from the car so the car won''t boot on
and i''m going to show you guys how to
you know register
keys that uh aren''t registered to the

the key light blinking here
the agreed key light means that it''s
it''s blinking meaning that there''s no

                             VALUES ('MVO_iMznwb0', 'all right here is everything that you
need
to make a bmw key
first things first i''ll go through the
price and and all that
you will need a laptop definitely a
laptop
it doesn''t really matter the specs so
much but you do need a laptop
you will need i''ll lay out everything
that i have here
so first of all high tag 2
version 3.1 bought from aliexpress so
it''s a clone of the high tag
tool this cost me and everything''s in
canadian dollars
the exact amount was 57 and i think 30
cents or something so 57.30
this is used to get the key blanks ready
so you will need high tag 2. the second
tool that you''ll need
is a bmw explorer clone so this does
plug into your obd2 port
bmw explorer clone it also comes with
whoops
the uh the key security key it''s a usb
stick but
they''ve uh they''ve
anyway it''s a key whatever
that cost me 127 canadian
you will obviously need blank keys so
these are the keyless go
so they''re the ones that uh their
comfort access plus
in other words you''re able to have this
in your pocket
and start the car you don''t actually
need to install insert it into the slot
these also come with a a blank
the blank key itself the blank blade
oops let me put that back in and these
cost
uh 18 a piece canadian
and that''s shipped all of these prices
are are the shipped fully landed prices
whether or not you get hit by duties is
uh
to be determined um but anyway it''s you
know
take a look and then finally so that''s
everything you need to actually program
the keys
so the keys will work with these tools
high tag is used to get the key to first
of all read a key
you do need a key already so it reads
your current key
it then gets a blank key ready
using some of the data in your existing
key
and then bmw explorer is used
to now program that key that has now
been
been ready from high tag into the cas
module now by doing this over obd
2 i will tell everyone that you should
have a car
charger a 12 volt dc car charger running
at least
five amps to the battery to maintain
connection because the
the whole process takes about 15 minutes
or so to do in the car
and obviously if you''re if you''re poking
around and not too sure what you''re
doing it might take a little bit longer
than that
and it does access different modules the
cas being one of them
so it will consume power your battery
does need to be maintained
up around the 13 volt mark so definitely
have a battery charger
and then this is a defu or defu
368a and it''s a key duplicating machine
so you''re able to put your key blade
your existing keyblade
in there put the blank in there and
actually make the key
this thing so these used to be
relatively cheap
i bought this for 178 dollars canadian
that''s shipped that''s a ship price so
all in with the electronics uh before
adding the keys the electronics
uh total was 184 dollars or thereabouts
and each of these are 18 canadian and
then this
you know 170 let''s call it 200 bucks
all in so really 400
which is the price of one single key
at most bmw dealerships here in canada
so for the same price that you can get
one key made you can make
as many keys as you want really
so let''s show you how it''s done oh by
the way the hardest part
of all of this is you''ll think that
these tools don''t work
it''s the damn drivers getting the
drivers and the software to work
you have to jump through hoops i''m
telling you right now uh
to get these things to actually work
with your computer
the drivers the drivers you have to go
on to uh
ftd website and download their driver
pack
you have to run some of these things in
compatibility mode
uh with the with high tag you also have
to because it''s a clone
you have to set your date back to 2010
like december
4th or whatever 2010 you have to jump
through hoops
to get these things to work with the
drivers so i will tell you now
that these are not plug and play when it
comes to working with the computer they
do work
they work they function don''t say that
they''re they''re
you know shitty things and they don''t
work they do work you just have to be
really good and know what you''re doing
to get the drivers to work on your
system for your system to recognize each
of these devices
once you do that you''re good you''re
golden uh but
that is the hardest part of all of this
getting the drivers to work
because it all is uh cloned and
imitation and all that
okay let''s get into it okay
very quickly i''ve got an e60 key from a
bmw 530
in a 60 high tag 2 version 3.1
in high tag you want to read the ide to
confirm that the key can be read
you can then go into the advanced
functions click on bmw
you can take a look at the key info
so it reads it all so that''s good cool
now we''re going to do is we''re going to
take out the good key
and we''re going to put in
a blank key
just uh
sorry that''s a case
there''s a blank key
yeah just stand up there so again
completely blank key we''re gonna get
this one
away from it and here we''re gonna click
on bmw explorer
i can''t start on programmer we''ll be
prepared you want continue
yes so writes that old information to
the key
and it''s done it''s now written it as a
bec
file so now we''re going to save that
back file to a usb
and put it into a different computer
that i will be
bringing out to the car
look a battery charger up i''ve got this
one set to
6 amps at 12 volts
right there all right i''m going to be
performing this in the car

2015 2016 Chevy Suburban yourself,
potentially saving money. This involves
synchronizing the fob''s transponder with
your vehicle''s immobilizer system.
First, ensure your Suburban is off and
all doors are closed. Insert your
existing working key into the ignition
and turn it to the on position, but
don''t start the engine.
Simultaneously press and hold the lock

about 15 seconds.

program up to a maximum of eight.
Finally, test each fob by locking and
unlocking the vehicle to confirm it''s
properly programmed. This method uses a
rolling code system. Each use generates
a new code to prevent replay attacks.
Precise timing is essential for success.
If the DIY programming fails, common
issues include incorrect timing during
the button presses or a low battery in
either the fob or the vehicle. A fully
charged vehicle battery is crucial. If
you''ve lost your original working fob,
you''ll likely need a dealer tool to
erase the old codes. While aftermarket
programming tools exist, using
incompatible ones can brick the fob,
requiring a costly dealer reset. Before
attempting DIY programming, ensure the
replacement fob is compatible with your
Suburban''s ECU, which you can typically
verify via the driver information
center, DIC. Keep in mind that while DIY
is feasible, professional reprogramming
is recommended for complex issues to
avoid voiding warranties or causing

programmed quickly. This video covers
remote pairing for Chrysler 300 models
from 2005 to 2023.
First, ensure you have your key fob and
the vehicle key. The basic principle
involves cycling the ignition to enter
programming mode and synchronizing the
fob with the car''s immobilizer and body
control module using a specific
sequence. Remember, precise timing is
crucial. Delays can reset the process.
Each fob has a unique code and
reprogramming overwrites old codes,
preventing duplicates. This guide
focuses on DIY methods applicable to
most models, but variations exist
depending on the year. If this process
fails, you will have to take it to a
professional, which will have a cost
associated. Make sure your car is in a
secure location to avoid any kind of
signal interference and prevent any kind
of theft.
Here''s the most common programming
method for your Chrysler 300 key fob.
First, insert your key into the
ignition. Turn the ignition to the onr
run position, but do not start the
engine. Within 4 seconds of turning the
key to onr run, press and hold the lock
button on the key fob for 1 second, then
release it. Repeat this process for all
key fobs you want to program up to a
maximum of four. After programming all
fobs, turn the ignition off. Finally,
test each key fob to ensure it''s working
correctly. If you have a newer 2015 or
later model with UK Connectnect, you
might be able to pair via the UK
Connectnect app if your vehicle''s
firmware is up to date. Scan the QR code
on the fob and pair via Bluetooth in the
vehicle''s settings. For troubleshooting
tips, first ensure the fob battery isn''t
dead. Check the Chrysler owner''s manual
for your specific model year for any
specific steps or variations.
If programming fails repeatedly,
consider visiting a dealership,
especially for high mileage vehicles
that may have BCM wear. Dealerships can
also help if the system locks you out

duplicate add another key for Kryer
Pacifica 2022. So, this is the new key.
It''s an OEM. So, you probably know that
Chrysler and DOT system from 2018 and
up, they need to use the star connector.
You cannot just connect it through the
OBD. So, I have uh these two ADC
2011A. So, uh what we''re going to do,
you can see it. We''re going to connect
it to one of the green dot. And then
we''re going to connect the OBD of the
outel. Sometimes I also do it with the
auto prop. So, I do prefer to use outl.
So, now we''re just going to connect the
cable to the OBD. We need to make sure
that we have a an internet. Right now,
it''s connected. So, we want to go to the
emo except we''re going to go to the
Chrysler. So, if you have a walking key,
you can just leave the key on and do the
other light. If you don''t have a working
key, that''s not a problem. Just do the
other light. Yep, you already make it.
Now, we''re going to read it again. So
establishing right now communication
Voyager is actually a Kryer Voyager no
Pacifica but it''s the same system
2022 with we''re going to go to control
unit password what we hit again turn off
the ignition and turn on the other D. So
the ignition was turned on we''re just
going to turn it off the hardest light
is already on. We''re going to hit and
now it''s establishing communication.
normally take about a 1 minute, maybe
two to get the pin code. So, it''s pretty
fast. So, it''s always good to take a
picture of the pin code. After that,
escape. We''re going to go into the
killer system. Key learning. Number of
kids. I always like to know how many
keys the car had. Current number of
keys, it''s two. Good. Key learning. Make
sure it''s off. Where you make sure two
kids, do you want to continue? Yep, you
do.
That''s the pin
code. Hold the proximity. So, we''re
going to do Okay. Now, we''re going to be
ready with the new key. We''re just going
to hit the unlock next to the
console. Uh I like kind of do a lot of
clicks. Uh 2 3 seconds of a click until
we''re going to hear the unlocked on the
car. That''s it.
So, right now, as you can see, current
number three, learn successful. Do you
want to learn an extra key? No, we
don''t. So, we''re going to hit no. That''s
it. Looks good. Let''s test some of the
buttons. So, this is an OEM key. As you
see, I used to use an aftermarket keys,
but for this type of car, the
aftermarket is not the best, and I used
to have a few
recalls. So, I do recommend it to do an
OEM key for this specific one. So the
most important thing we''re just going
to make sure it''s
starting. It''s good. Starting looks
good. And uh we need we still need to
cut the the emergency key and we''ll be
good to go. All right. Right. So now
we''re just going to decode the key. Then
we''re going to cut it. Going to go to
Dodge. Let''s say Caravan. We don''t have
to even though if it''s for uh Fiser
Pacifica Voyager, same key. So it''s not
have to be the very same one. Key
decode. Confirm. So I''m going to close
it and we''re going to hit cut some. Now
we just finished the cut. We''re just

and I hope you enjoy watching my videos.
Good morning, Noble Locksmith fam and
the rest of the locksmith world out
there. We''re making a new key, spare key
for a 23 Chrysler Pacifica. Um, these
are good contracts that a lot of people
don''t think about, but the mobility type
of van outfitters,
um, you know, they get a key, they get a
car in, they''re going to outfit it for
the customer, and then they always want
that customer to have two keys. So, we
get a lot of business from these guys.
Um, but this is, uh, easiest way to do
this one''s a starport.
Um,
so you''re going to go to this pillar,
uh, B-pillar.
I''m wrong. Ron will correct me. And
you''re going to pop this bad boy open.
And, tada. Now, I don''t have the uh,
Smart Pro on my van. I have the Altel,
which is fine. Um, you can use the
Altel. problem is with the Altel
or not a problem. Um,
you got to have power on the OBD
port,
which is not a problem. Um, so what you
got to do
is
hook
kind of sucks. You got to have a you got
to have an extension basically. Um and
they sell these on Amazon. You don''t
have to do this with the Smart Pro. Of
course, you got to do it with the auto.
So,
turn that car around. I hope it''s long
enough. Yeah. Yeah, it should be because
it''s uh we''ll see. We''re going to we''re
going to make it long. Oh, yeah. Plenty
long.
So, I have this long extension here.
and we''re going to we''re going to plug
our AltEl
Maxi Flash
uh into this cord. And of course, since
this is Bluetooth, we''re just going to
set it up front.
So, as you can see, I''ve got my Maxi
Flash plugged in up there. And then I''m
going to plug in my star port.
It''s a little freaking hole.
Hold on a second. Star port is all
twisted up. How in the hell?
So, the other way to do this is with the
12 plus 8 cable. Um, I think we have a
video of that up.
So, I got to find out how to figure out
how to get way down in there. I might
have to pull this
further off cuz Yeah, I can''t. Let me
see if I can move some stuff around,
which means
break some No, I won''t do that.
All right.
Oh,
I''m going to pull some trim back
so we can get in there cuz you have to
plug into that green one.
It''s kind of annoying. You got the green
plugs plugging into the
white block and the white one''s plugging
into the green, but you got to go into
that green one right there. And um
so we''re going to plug right there. I''m
going to set my camera back here
for a second
so I can do this.
Two hands.
All right. So we got that plugged in
there.
Smack the hell out of my temple. I''m
going have a headache now. Now we can
just sit back here and relax.
We got both keys with us. Of course,
we''ve only got to program one in.
So, we''re going to go to EMO.
We''re going to
accept it. We''re going to go to
Chrysler.
We''ll do an auto selection.
It fails a lot on Mopar.
All right. So, we pulled the VIN.
If it fails, that''s okay. We''ll go back
and do a manual selection.
All right. It found it. So that''s what
we''re working on. 23 Pacifica. We''ll
click okay. All right. Now we want to go
to the control unit.
pause to take this call. I''ll be right
back. And we''re back. So first thing
we''re going to do is read a mobilizer
password and try the can. Um turn
ignition off and hazards on. So turn
that on. Get those hazards on
and click okay.
Configuring.
Now, I''m in the habit of taking a
picture of the pin code when it comes
back. I''ve just had a few times where
you don''t take it and then you got to
enter it in, you forget it. And man,
that sucks. And then the thing you
always try to do is you try to go back
and get it again and then you start
having some issue with the car and you
can''t get the damn PIN code back again.
Um, so I''m going to let this run for a
second. Uh, as soon as it gets done,
I''ll be back.
All right, we got our password. So,
we''re going to click okay. Now, just so
you know,
if you''ve got a Smart Pro and you''ve got
your Starport connector, absolutely do
this with the Smart Pro. No question. uh
much easier, much quicker. Um and we
have Smart Pro. I just have it on my
van. Um I don''t usually do these jobs. I
do most of the European stuff, but my
other guy came here this morning, did a
job, and he went down to Carvana to do
some jobs, and I was right down the
street when they called back for a
second car. Um so, we''re knocking this
one out now. But this is also
anformational channel uh for YouTube.
So, maybe you don''t have a Smart Pro and
you got an Altel, Altel 508, maybe. Um,
well, this is going to do it. So, we''re
going to escape back out of there. We''re
going to go to our keyless system.
Key learning. Number of keys. Always
check first.
So, we got three.
That''s good. When we''re done, we should
have four. So, we''re going to go to key
learning. Make sure the ignition is off.
We''re going to click yes. We want to
learn the key. And here''s my key. So,
that time it saved the password and put
it in for us. Alt''s pretty good about
that. Smart pro also.
So, hold the proximity key near the
start button.
So, we''re going to press okay.
And then we''re just going to hit the
unlock button
till we hear the doors.
And you just keep hitting it.
I like to move it around.
Hold my tongue to the left. All right.
So, we just got locked. So, that only
took about 75 clicks.
And so, learning successful. Do we want
to learn the next key? No, we''re good.
So, now we''re go to number of keys.
Double check. Number keys four. So, now
you''re done. So, uh, just to go back
over it real quick with the AllTel, you
do have to have power
to the star port. Um, Smart Pro, you
don''t. So, we''ve got our extension
jumper that goes into the OBD. Then, we
plug our our pass through uh connector
into the extender. And then our extender
runs all the way back here to our star
port. Um, and then we we do everything
on the Altail. So, this is a lot easier
when you got your star port right over
here on the kick panel. These are the
only ones that have it back here, the
the the van. So, that''s how you do
those. Uh, you know, I cut the keys for
the customer already. Lease you that bad
boy. And, uh, you''re good. So, thanks
for watching. Uh, if you have any
questions or comments, just put them in,
uh, just make, uh, you know, put them on
the, uh, comment section. And if you
have any other cars you want to see,

The other thing I''m going to be using to

to do is grab my key fob and remove the
emergency key that''s in the bottom of
it. That''s done by pressing this release
on the back of the fob that my thumbs
on. And the emergency key will pull out
like that. Just set that to the side.
Now, if we hold our key fob with the
buttons facing down and we take a look
at the bottom of
it, this slot right here is where that
emergency key slid out of. And then just
below that, we see this slot right here
that I''m touching with the end of the
screwdriver. What I''m going to do is
take my screwdriver and put it in that
slot. Then I''m just going to twist the
screwdriver like I''m opening a lock with
a key. And as I do that, you can see it
starts to open the case. I''ll come over
here and kind of do the same
thing. Once it''s far enough apart, can
just pull it the rest of the way apart
with your hands like that. The back half
of the case, we see our battery right
here. I''ll use my screwdriver to get
under the edge of the battery and pop it
out of that little
holder. I''m going to grab my new
replacement battery. And you want to
make sure that you''re installing that
with the plus side down, positive side
down. And I''m going to tuck this edge in
first by this metal battery clip. So,
tuck that edge in first like that. And
then snap it down into place. Then we

fob is straightforward. First, ensure
your Edge is unlocked with all doors
closed. Have your replacement fob ready
and optionally a working original. New
aftermarket fobs cost $ 20 to $50. The
programming involves cycling the
ignition from off to run repeatedly
while pressing the lock unlock buttons
on the fob. This process synchronizes
the fob with your car''s receiver module.
It may take 5 to 10 minutes and can
program up to four fobs. If the process
fails, check for signal interference or
try disconnecting the car battery for 10
minutes to reset the module. Remember,
these fobs use radio frequency signals
around 314 MHz, so ensure compatibility.
If pairing fails, ensure you''re using a
genuine or OEM equivalent fob, as
counterfeit fobs often won''t work. The
fobs use rolling codes for security, so
unauthorized duplication isn''t typically
a concern. However, incorrect
programming attempts can drain the car
battery or trigger anti- theft mode. If
issues persist, an OBD2 scanner can help
diagnose problems. If your fob got wet,
attempting DIY repair can damage your
BCM. Professional help is recommended.
While newer Ford models utilize
smartphone-based keys, physical fobs are
still reliable for 2011 to 2015 edges.
DIY fixes can save $100 to $150 compared
to dealership costs.', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

Ford Explorer. Let''s get it. Very loose.
The good thing about a good quality
battery maintainer is you can save
problems like this.
See how this post is super wiggly
and sparking? With a good battery
maintainer, you technically don''t even
need a battery for the key programming
process. So, get a good one. If you need
to boost the vehicle, that''s a different
story, but also get a good one.
Okay. 2018 Ford Explorer using the Auto
Propad G2
mobilization. Agree to the terms. Ford,
no key detected. We''re going to fix
that.
Okay. So, this one we''re going to go by
vehicle because we if we can turn the
ignition on, automatic search will work
where it''ll just pick up the correct
immobilizer system. If you can''t and
it''s all keys lost, then we just got to
go by vehicle. This is a smart key. We
are working on an Explorer.
This is a 2018.
Turn on the ignition switch. If you lose
all the keys, please turn the hazards
on. So, we''re going to turn on the
hazard light right here.
Click okay to continue.
So, we''ll get a B-roll shot of where I''m
going to put the key, but it belongs in
the center console in here for the key
learning procedure. So, just slide the
key in there. We''ll wait for this to
think. Um, okay. So, we''re going to
click on all keys lost.
The alarm is not active. We open up the
door. The alarm isn''t sounding. So,
that''s less work for us. Alarm not
active. It''s going to delete all the
keys. And it requires at least two new
keys to be able to start the engine. So
I click yes. Turn on the hazard lights,
which they already are. Press okay.
Press okay.
We got some things clicking and some
things turning on here. That''s a good
sign.
This car is acting a bit unusual.
Anyway, successfully erased the keys.
That''s good. Place the key in the
programming slot. Press okay.
Door lock cycle. That means it''s
successfully programmed. On the dash
here, it says not enough keys learned.
If you can see that on the tool, it says
the key programming was successful.
There''s one key. Okay. We do want to
program another one. So, hit yes. We''re
going to swap our keys out.
Listen for those door locks to cycle.
There we go. Key successfully programmed
on the dash.
All good things. Tool says key is
successfully programmed. The current
number of keys is two. We don''t want to
program another one. That''s all there is
to it. Let''s see if this works.
Lock and unlock. Working. Lock and
unlock. Working.
And a very dead battery once again.
Let''s grab a booster to make sure it
starts.
Good. Booster''s hooked up.
Oh, no. No, no, no. There we go. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay,
both keys have successfully started it.
So, now we''re going to move to our
cutting, picking, all that jazz. Thomas
has got the locks picked already. So,
now he''s cutting the blades to see if
they turn in the door lock cylinder, and
then we''ll be done.
So, right now, Thomas is cutting a test
blade to make sure that we don''t waste a
really expensive key and get the cuts
incorrect. So, as soon as he''s done
that, we''ll test it and then we''ll
actually finish cutting the keys.

you
if you have two working keys that start

key no problem at all so just watch the
process here we''re gonna do an onboard
programming as long as you have two
working keys also they have to be
original keys they can''t be a clone if
they''re a clone you may have two working
keys if it''s a clone it''s not going to
add the third key so it has to be to
what we call master keys and then you
can add a third or fourth key so this is
the process here there''s no ten-minute
wait time it''s just pretty simple two
working keys program the third try it
and you''ll see I''m gonna onboard program
the 2014 Ford Mustang you have to have
two master keys that will start the car
so the two keys that will start the car
already to add in a third key so we''re
gonna onboard program this is a super
chip this is custom made and I should be
able to onboard program this third key
and a fourth key and a fifth key
whatever I want so I have two functional
master keys now they cannot be a clone
if one of these is a clone you cannot do
onboard programming with a clone
so you have to have two master keys that
both start the car so it''s three to five
seconds so we''re going to do this and
put in key number one one two three four
put it in the second key one two three
four
throw in the fifth key the third key
perfect so now all three keys and we can
even test the other two keys just to

You can program a new one yourself on
your 2017 GMC Sierra 1500, saving time

fob''s radio frequency with your truck''s
receiver module. Note that as of late
2025, the process remains largely
unchanged from GM''s original guidelines.
While aftermarket tools and apps can
assist, this video focuses on the manual
method using your truck''s built-in
system. Keep in mind that the vehicle''s
body control module, BCM, stores up to
four fobs. Programming overwrites old
ones. Battery depletion in key fobs
remains a common issue. Ensure you have
a fresh battery in your new fob before
starting.
First, ensure all doors are closed and
the key is out of the ignition.
Next, insert the key into the ignition.
Turn it to the on position, but don''t
start the engine, then back to off.
Repeat this cycle three times within 10
seconds. The driver information center
may display remote learn pending.
Immediately, press and hold the lock and
unlock buttons on the new key fob
simultaneously for 15 seconds.
Finally, cycle the ignition again to the
on position and test the key fob. Repeat
steps two through four for any
additional fobs you want to program. If
the process fails, try again ensuring
precise timing or consider using an

can interfere with the BCM signal.', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

how the tip it''s off center. We want to
pay attention to that orientation to
match the new key. The reason why is
look at that. See how that tip is
offset? We want to put in that way
first. So that''s side
one. And then we took it out, flipped
it, and put in side two. As you see,
it''s a different
cut. So, the Jim Condo will never show
the code for this. I don''t know why.
It''s just not given. Kind of like a
Subaru. So, if we look at side two, the
part we just did. So, side two is here.
What you see here, that looks correct
where it''s
133. Cool. And let''s flip this
over. Does that pattern look correct?
Yep. Let''s go ahead and cut it.

And we''re done. We cut
it and we''re good to go. Other than
that, have a great day and I''ll see you

if you''re adding a key you can just do

that I have is a Ford standard kind of
stuff I have a Toyota GM you know a lot
of everyday kind of remotes you might
expect to see up on a key rack now I''ve
taken the liberty of REM removing and
totally omitting all the transmitters
which are kind of finicky or nightmare
program or the ones that require the use
of an external scan tool or a computer
or a software program anything like that
which would deter you from being able to
do this yourself so know that in advance
I''ve already done the leg work for you
so if you see this video and you''re
watching it um and this is the one for
your specific vehicle which again is in

have say an 08 GM but you have an 09
thinking it''s close enough just do
yourself a favor go to my channel look
in there for your for your specific year
making model there might be another one
that''s more relevant so these things are
pretty vehicle specific so take good

complaining because the text is too

Honda Accord key uh to work with your

now this pretty much works with all
modern Honda cords um if you''ve got the
key then you''re all set if you got if
you got a key like this then this will
work they all pretty much have the same
concept so um what you want to do is
first of all I I''m going to change this
key this is an old uh key that''s broken
and this is the original key that came
with this car but unfortunately it''s
broken so you''re going to need the
original key or just the key a key that
you use with your car that''s going to
turn the ignition um and you''re going to
need this of course so you probably have
this already and I bought this from eBay
I saved uh
around 180 bucks buying this this was
for
$14 um and it''s not copied yet but I''m
going to go to Ace and they''re going to
copy this for me and uh Hey I''m going to
save around 180 bucks just doing this if
I go to Honda and they copy the key and
program it for me I''m going to have to
spend
$200 which is a total waste so I''m going
to do it myself and I highly recommend
you guys do it too so anyways we''re
going to go ahead and program this so
all you want to do is you want to grabb
your original
key and then you want to go to your
ignition and what you want to do is you
want to insert the key in there all
right so what we''re going to do is we
are going to turn the ignition on to
number two so if you see right there
there are numbers so this is zero one
two and three three will turn your
engine on two will turn your radio and
your uh pretty much your AC on and one
will just put your car in
standby uh but it will not as you can
see there the time the timer is on but
the radio is not on um so uh actually
the radio is on but the AC is not on so
if I go to two it''s going to turn on the
AC and the
dashboard so what we''re going to do is
we''re going to go on to number two and
we''re going to do this every time I''m
going to turn off the AC so what what
you want to do is you want to press
block you see that
led now go
back go to number two
again
Lock close the
car go to number
two
Lock close
this now you want to go back to number
lock
close the
car go to number two
again you see that you guys hear that
the car just locked so I''m going to lock
it and then I''m going to open
it as you can see there we just
programmed this for
free so we''re going to step out the
car and it''s
nighttime I''m going to close
this
and we''re going to get
close and we''re going to lock it using
this new key let me just focus this
so lock
it you see there just locked the car

easiest, and most economical way to make
a spare key for a Honda or Acura View. I
apologize for any wind noise in the
audio today. Hopefully, you can still
hear me well. Before I jump in the car
and show you how easy it is to program
this key, I''m going to start this phone
call to the Honda dealership to find out
what they''re going to charge and how
long they would take to make a spare
key. With the call underway, let''s jump
in and start programming this spare key.
At tomsky.com, you can order spare keys,
programming device, and be sure you
include our optional key by photo
service. More on that later. As you
begin programming, it''s important to
know you must have one working key that
starts the engine. This one with the
tile keyfinder, so I can always find my
keys. Fires the engine up. The remote
buttons on this key still work. But even
if they don''t, as long as you have a key
that starts the engine, you can use
Tom''s Key Company do-it-yourself
solutions to help make a spare key for
your vehicle. All right, to start out,
we got to scan the QR code. With the app
installed, we''re ready to begin
programming. Your spare key will need to
be cut to fit your vehicle. I recommend
using our key by photo key cutting
service. It''ll save you a bunch of time
and hassle by having your Q drive
already cut to fit your vehicle. So,
we''re gonna pair key. We need to find
the OBD port and plug in this
programming device. On most vehicles,
it''s down near the gas and brake pedal.
Sometimes it can be behind a little
cover here. This cord, it''s right
there. That thing plugged in. To make
your life a little easier, you can grab
this optional extension cable to see
what''s going on with the programmer.
Now I can see that my programmer has
power. We''ve got to get the Bluetooth
communication working. All right, we
need to find the device. There''s a
matching serial number here. May need to
press to scan. Let''s see if we can get
our Bluetooth connection
made. And there we go. We saw the com
light turn on. We''re ready to
continue. Okay. It''s helpful to know
that there is technical support
available Monday through Friday daytime
business hours. So that can be really
helpful if you run into problems. Let''s
begin
programming. Okay, calibrating the tool.
We need to enter license plate for scan
the VIN. This isn''t 100% foolproof, but
let''s go give it a shot. I''m going to go
try the license
plate. Enter license plate. Here we go.
2017 Honda Accord. That is correct for
this vehicle. All right. This is a
turnkey
ignition. So, we''ll do the key version.
Smart key is a push button start
ignition. All right, some important
points. Might take up to 15 minutes, but
no longer than that. Don''t leave the app
during programming. And be sure you''ve
got all existing keys previously
programmed, like this one, as well as
any new ones that are going to be
made. Okay, let''s begin programming.
While this is initiating, let me tell
you a couple important things. While you
do this, I recommend you turn off the
HVAC, heating, cooling, roll down the
windows if it''s hot day, turn off the
headlights, the radio, anything that''s
drawing battery from the vehicle because
you don''t want your vehicle battery to
run out during the programming process.
You could even connect a trickle charger
to your battery if you''re concerned it
might be weak. Let''s see how that phone
call with car dealership''s
gone. Still a lot of
old. While we''re waiting, let me tell
you about our key by photo key cutting
service. This is pretty amazing stuff.
When you place your order, you can add
our optional key by photo key cutting
service. You''re going to snap a few
photos of your key, move it around to
get different angles with the phone
directly above the key, sitting on a
flat surface like a table. You want us
to be able to see with the photo the
proper cuts to make. Then using our
keyby key cutting technology, we''ll cut
your new key to fit your vehicle. It''s
pretty amazing. It''ll arrive already
fitting. Okay, we''re almost done here.
Getting ready. Please
wait. All right. Turn the ignition two
clicks forward to the on position. Don''t
start the engine using your currently
programmed key. Okay, let''s
continue. Make sure the ignition is in
the on position with the engine off with
the currently programmed key before
clicking continue. Yes, that is correct.
Engine''s not running. I do see some
lights on the dashboard.
Continue. Please wait.
Turn the ignition off. Do not remove the
key. Okay. One two. Ignition is off.
Please wait. If you run into a little
problem, you can contact techport. You
might try starting
over. Please wait. Turn the ignition on
again using the same
key. There you go. One.
Two. Reading the key. Please wait.
key. One, two. Remove the key from the
ignition less than 15 seconds. Insert
new key and turn two clicks to the on
position. Okay, here''s a new one.
Putting it in. One,
two. I look on the dash. I notice a
green security light blinking. That''s a
good sign. Part of programming process.
key. One. Two. Security light is still
blinking. Turn the ignition on again
with the same key. One,
two. Turn the ignition off. Security
light continues to
blink. Turn the ignition on again. Same
key. One, two. I''ve noticed now that the
security light has turned off. Okay. Is
the security light flashing or on at
this time? No, the security light has
turned off. No, it is turned off. Turn
the ignition off. Do not remove the
key. One,
two. Turn the ignition off again with
the same
key. Okay, please wait. Success.
Awesome. Programming successful. Before
I test this out, let''s see how the phone
call with the car dealership''s going.

Um, and how long does that take?
One full service day. A full service
day. So, like I got to drop the car off.
It''s not like bring it in. Just spend a
little bit of time there.
you would drop it off and then you''d be
able to get it back.
Do you know if there''s any faster or
cheaper ways like I might any church out
there to get a park team made?
All right. Uh thank you so much for the
info. Can you believe that?

day at the dealership. Why would anyone

device. Here we go. Let''s test out our
new
key. Crank the engine. There we go.

buttons now. Here''s the original

to cut that we want to add to the car so
uh we''re going to go to manual selection
and we will go to
CRV blade
key and let''s go to control unit
immobilizer
okay ignition is
on and the thing you should know about
these key the these cars that not
everybody knows sometimes people lose
all their keys um except let''s say the
valet key and then they want to make a
key from there and you''ll go ahead and
try to add Keys using the valet key
which is this one right here and you''ll
just get a fail and not know what''s
going on so the reason why is because
you can cannot use that key to add keys
to the car cuz it''s a valet key so um
what you got to do is you got to just do
all keys lost and a registered key is
already in the ignition turned on we''ll
just go ahead and turn it on again with
that key and just click
[Music]
okay and all you got to do is just
follow the instructions
and you want to turn it on with the new
key so we''ll put this aside and we''ll
take one of the new keys put it in there
turn it
on and turn it
off on
off and what we want is that green light
to disappear turn it on
again and the green light
disappeared and that is now added to the
vehicle we know the programming was
success and did the lamp go out that''s
talking about the green light and as I
showed you it did go out so we know
that''s all good to
go and the current number of keys is now
four we''ll say okay and now we want to
go ahead and this is now registered so
we''ll add another key to the car um
using that key to register this but it''s
the same process so you guys don''t need
to see the rest of that and I''ll show
you that the car starts here you go so
again do not use valet keys to add key
to the car because it will not work you
need to use an original um master key in
order to program so 2013 Honda

We going to do all key lost.
And first I want to show you how to cut
the key by the code and how where to
find it. So you got to find the code
from the glove box. Take off the the the
handle here
which is this one. It has two screw on
the top. There is a cover first.
Take off the cover. Two screw right
here. And all this will come off. All
right. And when it come off, you see
this one already. Take it off. But this
one, it has clips right here.
One clips right here on the back. Just
lift those clips. Three clips. One here.
One here and one on the side, I think.
Yeah. One here and one right here. Take
this one off.
All right. And then you have this one
here.
This one to hold the cylinder. Just take
it off too. Just peel it. Pull it. Come
off like this. And take this cylinder
off. All right. And if you check it, you
will see the code
right here.
And you need the last four
start with L385.
Always on Honda you need the last four.
I think the new cars 2014
15 sometime they put those code on the
middle in the front.
But most of them the last four and start
with the letter
and you go to the machine
go to Honda all key lost Honda and with
this code I will give you the correct
key cutter and this is the key already
cut it and now need to program it. Let
me connect the power show you how to
program it with the key tool max pro.
All right guys, we have a power and the
ignition is on and the security light is
that one blinking. That mean the key is
not programming. And this key when you
program the key the control automatic
is from 2007 to 2013 the same thing.
All right. So
we connect our tool to the OBD.
Go to key tool max pro. Go to imo
programming.
We go to Honda.
Start with letter H. Click Honda.
And then we select by type.
IMO system
and fly the IMO type.
IMO programming.
Click this one.
Click okay. Turn the ignition off. Keep
it on. Ignition on. Click okay. And here
we have add key loss. We have to do all
key lost.
All right.
Click all key lost. Turn the ignition
off.
Click okay. Turn the ignition on. Click
okay. How many keys you need? Uh we need
just one. Click okay. All
right. Now, it''s going to ask you turn
the ignition off
and turn the ignition on. And now going
to tell you quick ignition off and on.
So you have to do it.
Okay. Ignition off and on. See ignition
off and on.
Keep it on. Now off.
On.
All right. Now check the security light
is off. All good. Click yes. Turn the
ignition off. Turn back on.
Now we wait.
All right. Complete. Good to go. And
now,
uhoh, this the battery.
All right. Let me connect. All right.
Start.
All right. Again, the battery. But
anyway, this is this is done. Uh the
control should work automatic now.
And yeah, that''s it. This is how you get
the code and this how you program it.
And not sure, not always you will find
the code right here, but just in case
have a le is with you. All right,

you need to find where your OBD2 port is
come by the gas and brake pedal look
around
until you find a plug you can fits this
you''re going to plug it in
now to make it a little bit easier I''m
going to use this extension cord
and plug in the programmer so you got to
have a key that starts the engine in
order to use our equipment to make
additional keys today we''re going to be
making two spare keys so we''ll have a
total of three when we''re all done to
help keep them straight I''ve got the
tile key finder on the original it''s the
Honda logo you can get this and it pairs
to your smartphone so you can always
find your keys then we''ve got the one
key has a key ring another key without
the key ring to begin you got to get the
app on your phone and then you go
through a pairing process it''s going to
tell you to scan a QR code make sure you
scan the right one one of them is for
instructions the other one is right here
and
One Stop scanned it''ll tell us a few
things we got to have a Wi-Fi connection
we''ve got to have our original key and
we''ve got to have our programming easy
installer programming tool
okay then you need to get the put the
vehicle information sometimes the VIN
scanner works sometimes it doesn''t so
I''m just going to go ahead and plug in
that we''ve got a Honda this is a CRV
and notice there''s a couple different
ranges 2015 to 2020 and if you come in
here this one''s asking for a smart key
we don''t have a smart key a smart key
you''d push a button on your dashboard to
start the engine this one we put a key
in and turn it to start the engine so
that''s wrong we got to come back to the
2001 to 2020. this is a 2014 CRV that
we''re working on today
and we''ve got a blade key okay I''m going
to take my original key put it in the
ignition and turn it two clicks to the
on position I''m not starting the engine
foreign
we''ve got some communication going on
so give us some instructions we need a
paired key required to perform
programming so we need a working key
that already starts the engine we can
make up to five keys and we''re selecting
what kind of keys program so what''s
going to happen is we''re going to try
this key that has the key with remote if
that doesn''t work we may need to do this
option over here we''re going to make two
keys and none of those we''ll come back
and do this if the remote isn''t working
after the first programming okay turn
off the ignition
turn the ignition on with the paired key
so this is our original key
it''s important there''s timing
requirements so you gotta follow the
timing carefully within 30 seconds we''re
going to turn off the ignition
and we''re going to turn it back on now
okay it tells us there''s three keys
paired to this vehicle already
turn off the ignition
turn on the ignition with an unpaired
key so that means I''ve got to take my
new key
pull out the working one put one of the
new ones in
turn that ignition on I''m not trying to
start the engine
and we''re going to turn off the ignition
okay turn on the ignition
on these Hondas you go through that a
little bit on and off on the dashboard
right now you may notice there''s a
blinking green security light and that''s
normal that''s part of the programming
process when the key works that light
will not be on turn off the ignition
turn on the ignition
okay we''ve now got four keys so this one
works
all right turn off the ignition
so turn on the ignition with an unpaired
key so we''re taking our second spare key
now no key ring
I''m gonna put it in
strangely it did not get our fifth key
so no the security is not off it failed
to pair the key I''m gonna take this out
remember this is the one we haven''t
programmed yet
if I try to start the engine
see how the security light turns on is
all then it''s just blinking so it''s not
working
I''m going to come back in here we''re
gonna run this app again got a Honda
CRV and the 2001 to 2020 is the one that
had the blade key so I''m taking my
original working key turning the
ignition on
I''m not starting the engine
it''s turned all the dashboard lights on
phone tells us it''s busy communicating
all right
we just need to make one of these
okay turn on the ignition with a paired
key so a working key original working
cue that''s already paired to the vehicle
tells me there''s four Keys okay
so we know we have four Keys already for
this vehicle
key so I take out my original
here''s that fifth key we''re trying to
pair
it''s now paired this fifth key
okay no more keys to be can be paired to
this vehicle maximum number
okay
okay is the security light off yes it''s
off
okay so we''ll say yes it''s turned off
key pairing is complete
all right we''re done
we just made two spare keys for this
vehicle now we got three keys to use
unfortunately because this is used
vehicle there''s two other keys out out
there somewhere in the world have been
lost in somebody''s drawer somewhere that
start this vehicle but now we''ve got
three spare keys so if we lose a key
we''ll always have a spare note all right

the AL key there is a key I''m coming to
generate this key to program the car the
car the client bought the car brand new
so a used car so he wants me
to give him another key so that even if
they have spare key they can''t move the
car so I''ll do all key loss and add two
keys to the system so you can see this
ID 47
this ID 47 so I''m coming to generate the
key and I have to test the frequency
also to know the kind of frequency the
vehicle is
using so let me do the
test this 4 ter um Sorry 4 teritory
yeah so I''ll know the kind of key to
generate for the system so now as I know
the chip ID and
the course now I know the chip because
now I know the chip ID I know the car
I''m working with so it''s
Honda and I have to do all KY losw for
the client so
that
CRV I really don''t know the year so I''ll
choose 2019 or 2018
and you can see the key start from 2017
to 2020 and it is 433 and it is the same
key type it is the same key type so I''ll
place it here with the remote in
it so I''ll place it here with the remote
in it then let me continue this is the
key that I want to generate so let me do
generate and for my for my km 100 I
misplaced my
I misplaced
my VCI so now I have to buy new VCI
before I can use the km 100 so I''m using
it for only key generation because if I
use the programmer I have to get um 12
volt power supply to it and I don''t want
to go through that stress so with this
one what I''ll do is I''ll wait for it to
finish
generating for it to finish generating
the
key but for now it has to upgrade the
key so if you can see it upgrade it then
after the upgrade it''s now upgrading the
key boot loader before it''s going to
before it to generate the key it has to
do all these things before it will
generate the original key for me to use
so I think it is done with the boot
loader so it''s now detecting the key and
it''s now generating the universal key
which will take almost a minute
which is 60
seconds so I''ll just wait for it to
finish with the key
generation so these are the new keys
that I''ve bought to do this kind of
works so that if my clients buy new
vehicles and they don''t really trust one
or two things I raise all the keys and
add another key for them to secure the
car for them so that no one can just
come and drive the car and move because
it''s something they do a lot they will
sell the key to they will sell the card
to you and give you one key then later
in the days or maybe in months they will
come and drive the car off and move away
if you don''t register it even if you
register they do that so I''ll do this
key for my clients then I''ll go and do
the programming or key lost but I''ll be
using the IM uh the IM 60 because i'' I
don''t have my VCI with me if I had the
VCI complete if I had the VCI I could
have just used my VCI to do the
programming so let me read the key ID
and see if it is ID
47 yeah it is ID 47 it is not locked so
go back again
and exit and go to frequency and test
the frequenc frequency and make sure the
frequency matches the original
key yeah 433 and there is the original
key for the vehicle that one also is
433 yeah and this one also is
433 yeah so I''ll add the
key then I''ll call it the fix thank you
for watching subscribe to my channel for
more videos so the ignition is able to
turn on because I have the two keys this
is the new one I''m programming you can
see the difference this is the new one

original

let me it''s a smart key it is pushed to

this so I didn''t select let me do the
emot
scan then T me to press it twice but I
don''t need to do that because the

system but my client has only one key so
only one key was given to my client so

can thanks and I hope you enjoy watching
my
videos all right we are working on a 20
20 Honda CRV uh Pro key it''s an all keys
lost she wants two keys um I''m going to
go ahead and generate the altel
universal um I have this key but I want
to just make a video on generating this
I''ve selected the year making model
Honda they only have uh two
possibilities or two fcci IDs for these
style proc key so you''re not going to
get it wrong but just wanted to make a
video on how to make this key I love
these all Keys I''ve said it in another
video this key it''s always going to work
so I''ve selected it um got to put a
battery in this key they come without it
just pop it in the uh programmer up here
hit
generate generate Universal
key and it is going to make that key um
I''ve already made one I''ll pause this
while I get in the car and get that
started and uh we''ll be back on
programming all right back in the Honda
CRV going go through manual
selection CRV smart key push to
start uh we''re going to select control
unit keyless system
Honda this turn on by pressing start
button twice no it''s going to tell you
to hold the ignition button about 15
seconds to turn it
on so a pretty common problem on these
vehicles Honda push to start vehicles um
once you get through I''ll tell you when
we get there but if you get to
programming failed and you know you have
the right key part of the process on
these is only having one key in the car
so even though I''m making two you have
to do these one by one and you have to
keep the other one it says something
like 5 to 10
m and it ends up being right
um let''s get this figure it out first
let''s not do
this I know we have I got a blue light
on my
OBD let''s try this again
I got the lights on I know the car is
awake um if you get to key failed one of
their keys is still in here I''ve had it
happen multiple
times um like I said I''ll explain it
better when we get to that step but if
there is a key an existing key in here
or any other Honda procs really it''s
going to fail because when it when it
opens programming to take your key in if
it sees two it''s going to fail you out
of it and I don''t know why but twice now
I found the existing key that the owner
of the car thought they lost in the
passenger uh seat track under up under
the seat don''t ask me why but take a
shot at it if you get to that step uh
this is not going well I''m going to
switch the auto proad and be
back all right we are on a 2020 Honda
CRV um I generated to two keys with the
im608 with the altel universal Keys just
because I like those
keys and I know they are always going to
work as long as I generate the correct
key
um we''re adding this is all keys lost
situation we''re adding two proximity
Keys we''ll try auto
search Miss does not turn on Okay now
we''re going to hold
it it''s going to kick the alarm back
on shut the door get rid of some of that
noise at
least
okay smart key button to
start yes the ignition is
on we''re going to do all smart Keys lost
okay
um take mares out of the car more than
two meters away it is pretty serious
about that distance I was I tried this
one time by I was on top of a car hauler
by hanging off the car with my with the
key in my hand it was a good 5 ft away
and it wasn''t enough so you really need
to get the other key as far away as you
can um what I do with these is put the
key that I want programmed on top of for
the dash um you can put it on the seat
there''s antennas everywhere in this car
that''s never failed me do center console
seat um that usually works but I am
going to put this key pretty far
away sorry about the horn nothing I can
do about
it get back in the car hit okay and it''s
pretty much just going to say it took
that key
switch is on please turn that one off we
are making two keys
here all right we took that
key so we''re going to switch keys
so at that step if it had said
failed that means there is another key

Honda CRV hybrid.
Hello everyone. Today we''ll go over the
step-by-step instructions to add an
additional key using this pro key box
kit. You must have one working key to
add any additional key. This kit is
compatible with many Honda models. I
will add compatibility list at the end
of this video. This kit comes with the
aftermarket key, the programmer tool,
and the instruction manual. If you have
your own unprogrammed key, you can
purchase the programmer separately. This
tool will work on original or
aftermarket key. Today, we''ll program
the aftermarket key with the kit. Once
you use this programmer tool, it will
lock to your car vin. This means you can
reuse it many times in your vehicle, but
you cannot use it in any other vehicle.
So, to begin the process, you need to
connect the tool to the OBD board.
Once you connect it, take the new
unprogrammed key out of the vehicle and
only keep the programmed working key in
the vehicle.
Turn the ignition on, but do not start
the car.
From there, press button B and wait for
the blue light.
[Music]
Then take the working key out of the
vehicle and wait for the yellow light.
Once the yellow is blinking, bring in
the new unprogrammed key into the
vehicle and wait for the red and blue
lights to blink.
Once the red and blue are blinking, turn
the ignition off.
Then turn it back on.
We will repeat this three more times.
At the fourth time, you will hear the
tool long beep indicating the
programming is successful. And now it''s
all done. Your key is ready to go. You
can test your key by starting the
vehicle.
As you can see here, it''s working. Hope
you enjoyed the video. Thank you for
watching.', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

you''ll see it in a
second yeah 2014
cic
yes it was hot

functions in
moys yes it is the one push start
here you have to go through a lot of uh
menus there I think it only
one
culus now I think it says registration
or something like that
yeah
registration keyless access
remotes so we''re going to add
one and be careful and read everything
pretty much here we have done all these
things add keyless remote we''re in that
step so now from here on we have to pay
attention to what it
says so follow on the screen so when
you''re finished turn on the ignition
switch to off okay let''s go
so it must be one register keyless
remote which is the one that we already
have
now uh the keyless remote that is
capable of starting the engine must be
in the vehicle right now it is and I
also have the other one that I want to
configure in the vehicle I think at one
point I have to take it out of the car
the ignition must be switched to on
which is right now using the keyless
remote okay let let''s go and it''s
important also ensure the following to
reduce noise as much as possible during
keyless remote rest stration turn off
all the electrical devices so I turn off
the
radio um any dash cam that you may have
any Chargers anything like that uh turn
off all electrical devices navigation on
your system separate on the diagnostic
tool which is what we''re looking right
now from the keyless remote as much as
possible so I''m going to actually put it
maybe let it here there
um close all doors windows and sound
roofs yep it is and we can lock
them I can lock Jus is I don''t
know yep my windows were down because
I''m it''s h in
here okay this is a good sign
let''s take one original keyless access
remote into the vehicle right now it is
remove all other keyless access remotes
from the vehicle so here''s the good one
and here''s the bad the one that I want
to
configure let''s close
everything do not insert the keyless
access remote
vehicle um access remote slot is there''s
no slot here press the okay
button turn the ignition switch on
and good way is to do it like
this just in case to be close for the
immobilizer to be
red okay most likely what it''s doing now
it''s reading this key that is working
completely take all the original keyless
access remotes out out of the vehicle
remaining time 94 seconds all right now
I''m going to take it
out here it goes the good
one now it''s complaining of
course press okay to
continue
there only take one keyless access
remote into a vehicle
the new one let''s put the new
one in here okay so I BR in the new key
into the car I pressed okay and it said
key register successfully so I only have
the the old the new key inside that I
want to configure and it says now turn
it off so I''m going to turn it off like
this
boom now it says turning on by using the
no ignition whatever that is but try to
do this with a key super close one
two now let''s
see are both keyless imobilizer lights
to turn off yeah I don''t see any lights
that says complains that this is not a a
u yeah I don''t see any one any place
that says this is not a good key so
we''re going to press yes

We''re going to hit that right there. And
then I''m going to take
and put
third key in my pocket momentarily. I''m
going stick this in right here. Okay.
I''m going to hit generate.
Uh-oh. Can''t find any key. You can''t?
Well, I''m here. Let''s just try that
again.
Oh, anyway, so it shouldn''t really
matter.
No, it''s not. There we go. Focused.
So much shadow on it, but that''s okay.
We hit complete. try to do here is I''m
going to take not my forward key.
Uh let''s do this. Go back.
Back. We''re going to do transponder
clone. We''re going to stick their key

And we''re going to hit read transponder.
Okay. We''re going to hit clone.
Start clone. 46 transponder clone
check and key.
Okay, it says to take that out,
but this Oh, you know what? I don''t
think this is going to work cuz I''m
trying to do it with a uh
&gt;&gt; remote head key.
&gt;&gt; I''m using a new Yeah, it needed the
super remote and I''ve already made this
one up. We''re just going to go to the
vehicle. We got to cut this key first
and then we''ll go to the vehicle and
program it in. So hold tight them in.
Okay. So here we''re going to decode the
key and then I''ll just show you a little
trick at the end of doing that uh so
that we know whether it''s a valid code
or not.
Well, if it''s on like it was with the
last one, it won''t show a valid code.

&gt;&gt; Over here.
&gt;&gt; Oh,
&gt;&gt; okay.
&gt;&gt; I''m so sorry. Okay,
&gt;&gt; we''ll hit okay. All right. One thing I
always check is the very last numbers
need to be ones. Okay. At this point,
this is what it read. Now, we''re going
to hit find bidding
and see what comes up. There''s a valid
key code. So, we''re going to cut a
keyblade based on that. We feel
confident that that''s right. I feel
confident that that''s right. And uh and
then we''ll go to the car and program it

got our X100 Pro hooked up again. We''re
going to select key. key. Now, we
already got the customer''s key, so we''re
going to hit key, enter, add a key,
initializing communication,
switch ignition off.
Let''s turn it on with the original key.
Turn it off. Now, it''s going to ask for
the new key. Turn it on with the new
key.
Okay. Turn it off.
Turn it on.
Turn it off. Turn it on.
Is a light off? Best I can tell. I
wasn''t actually looking for it. So,
we''ll hit enter. Switch off.
Now, it''s going to ask for the original
key. And I''ve got to pull this one out.
&gt;&gt; Oh, no. I thought their ignition switch
going on bad.
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. It was just
&gt;&gt; You haven''t got it rolling.
&gt;&gt; Okay, here we go. Okay,
&gt;&gt; turning it on with the original key.
Okay, here we go. Key registration
completed. So, let''s take the Let''s go
on and start it with this one.
Starts with the original, which that
shouldn''t have changed. Now, we''ll try
to start it with this one.
Well,
&gt;&gt; he''s going to have to do something. I
don''t know what he''s
&gt;&gt; I should actually have
What I should have done was uh
Okay,
put the roll pin in, but always wait to
do that just in case we can''t get a
remote to work. Okay, so there it''s
cranked with the exhorse key. Now, let''s
check the remote
and the remote is not working.
So, we''ll have

recognize it. You know, computer to
reset or whatever you pay attention.
This is the original. The original''s
working now. We''ll take Oops.
Tuck that in my leg there. We''ll take
the Xorse and we''ll do unlock lock. It''s

2010 Honda Fit and what we''re doing
car is for reprogramming she didn''t have
a key fob for a car she has each type of
keys and she has no key file she just
got this car about a month ago and one
of the key fob so I''m just going to
reprogram the keys real quick this is a
key fighter you can get like an Amazon
or something that we think I think we
pay about 20 bucks for it now when you
get these with the key on it they''re not
cut obviously so you''ll have to take
them somewhere and get them cut but they
charge fifty five dollars to program
them so anyway twenty dollars for the
five and the key and then get a cut and
then we can use the launch here and
we''ll do a program on it it''s probably
going to have a three program all the
keys she has one key already without the
fob and then she bought two keys she got
this key and normal key that she wants a
program so we''re just got a program
these two new ones the five and then
probably have a probably have us
reprogram the other one she has usually
what it does is it''ll just have your
program vault once so right now it wants
to do a little firmware upgrade
something to let it do that anyway so
this is a you know like I said I think
the average price usually is about 55 or
60 bucks to program a key might be more
to dealership I''m not sure so if you
have if you know if someone that has an
auto or a launch it''s something that can
be done pretty quickly and maybe if you
know someone has one just throw them a
couple bucks and they can do it but
anyway we''ll go through the process here
I''m gonna get set up and we''ll go
through the process and reprogram these
keys real fast all right so this is the
this is the key that she had with the
car and you can see here if you put it
in
car starts right up and there''s no
issues at all with it you can see it''s
still running so when you get these keys
that are programmed and I lost them
it''s like this key here it''s cut it''ll
fit in the ignition but what''s gonna
happen when you turn it it''ll start and
die see the car is running and then it
dies right away if you have this Queen
key light right here flashing and that''s
because you know it''s not programmed to
the ECM so that''s the one with the key
fob then we have this other one that you
got it''ll do the same thing you''ll start
the car for a few seconds and then it
should you see their car starts dies
it''s about two seconds the green lights
flashing so we''re gonna fix that now so
what we''re going to do is go into so
we''re going to go in the Honda
put the key back in here trying to get
off a little bear here
of course you got this set up first
and we''re going out of keys find the
keys on here mobilizer
all right we''re gonna hit select keys
I''m gonna hit the wrong thing select
keys we''re just gonna add one key right
now so it''s the turn is to switch off
now it says turn to this and switch
along with the original key so we''re
going to do that now it says turn D this
switch off at the 17 seconds so we''re
doing that now it says turning this to
switch on with a new key within 20
seconds so we''re doing that now just
turn it off within 15 seconds now just
turn it on without changing the keys or
the new keys still in the ignition on
it''s asking if the immobilizer light
went off that''s the green key light so
we''re gonna hit yes now saying turn it
back off now it''s saying turn it on with
the original key so we''ll switch it back
over to the original key
now just turn the bag off okay it''s a
lot of uh now it says make sure it
starts with all the keys that we
programmed which we just program one for
now
so that''s turning the switch on so now
this is the new key the one that she
bought with the five and there you go
you can see it''s running the immobilizer
light is off so that particular key that
we just got is programmed and then now
we''ll try the factory key one more time
for the one that you got originally so
now I''ll fill the floor so now we''re
going to put our original key back in
does have a fob
and of course that one still looks good
so that was how you do if you''re just
gonna add one key since we have three
keys total all right since we got she
found another key so since we got four
keys total we''re just gonna rewrite them
all at the same time so right now we
have two that work but we''re not gonna
just add one key we''re gonna add two
more keys so somehow we got four keys
this car so she should never have a
problem losing the key on this car so
anyway it says how many keys you want to
register a maximum of six we''re gonna
say four hit okay now it says turn this
to switch off I got a few that''s going
to be a lot of on and off on and off
turn it on turn it off
now Susteren on with another key within
20 seconds turn it off turn it off
another key within 20 seconds so all I''m
doing is just going through the four
keys we have turn it off and then last
one via 4th keys to turn it on turn it
off now that''s when you turn it back on
without switching the key so I got the
fourth key in there just turn it off and
then back on the immobilizer light is
off so is turning the switch off now it
says turn on with the original key
all right so saying all four keys should
be registered so let''s test on this is
the original key
and you can see their mobilizers off and
it''s running so I go through real quick
and check off for these that''s the first
one this is the second one
you can see it''s just a lot turning the
keys on and off and switching the keys
around this one works go for the third
one and I guess I''m hiding that you can
have six in the ECM at one time this car
has four so that''s this one and then
this would be the last one the fourth
one all right
so these are all working jobs done for
her so you can tell you can see here if
you have an auto our launch is pretty
easy to reprogram the keys and the fobs
even if you have see you have a key five
and you lose it a lot of times you can
program the fives with Outlook skiing
tool but some of them you can''t in the
launch the auto can program those so I
know not everybody has access to one of
these types of skiing tools they''re
pretty expensive but if you know someone
that has one it''s pretty good it''s a
good it''s a nice option to have on this
type of scam tool and if you''re in the
st. Louis area you can contact me
through either Facebook or YouTube and I
come out and program your five or your
key for you usually charge twenty five
for that really depends on how many I
have and how far you are for where I''m
at but that is something that I can do
that''s something that I do do I go
places in program I just recently
programmed a couple key files for a guy
so that is something I can come to you
and do the only thing I don''t cut keys
so if you need your keys cut or
something like that I won''t be able to
do that for you
got to take that to a locksmith and
they''ll cut it for you but if you got a
key cut or if you got a replacement key
five you can save a lot of money call
someone like me and will come out and
reprogram it instead of take it to a
dealer another dealer it''s outrageous to
get this done and anyway so that''s
something I can do probably 10-15
minutes in your driveway if you live the
st. Louis area and if you do have a
problem Amazon is a good source for
those bob''s or the keys the keys are a
lot cheaper too through Amazon like I
said we got this key here that''s a key
fob built in with the key for $20 on the
amazon and then she had a cut to her
original key and then I just you know
you saw me reprogram it so and I think
they the locksmith won it I think a
hundred and ten for this key and the
program and cut it so she saved quite a
bit of money getting surprised at least
fifty bucks getting this on the Amazon
that having me come out
program it so anyway that''s it I''m gonna
go ahead and shut the launch down and
give all the keys back to her and she''ll
be on the way and this should be it
thanks for watching and like I said if
you are the st. Louis area go ahead and
contact me you through Facebook or
YouTube and I''ll come out and probably
I''m 45 or Yorkie for you and anyway
thanks for watching and we''ll see you on

you guys for watching. Today another
episode. We''re working on a 2017
Honda
HRV. So, what we''re doing here is we''re
adding a key. We''re working with the
Altel KM100. If you see that type of
remote, I did generate that remote with
the Xhorse Promax tool. And then that''s
a XN remote that we''re using here. So
once I generated that remote, I''m able
to go ahead and program this key
specifically to this vehicle. So what
we''re doing here, we do have the key on
the on position and we''re doing an auto
detect to go ahead and just extract the
data. So it can go ahead and connect to
the the computer so it can retrieve all
the information. If you could see there,
it''s giving you some option if it''s a
smart key, a blade key. So we go ahead
and choose it''s a blade key. Then we''re
going to go to the hot functions and
choose that option. And then it''s going
to go ahead and communicate with the
computer.
So there it''s a fourth keyblade system.
So here all we''re doing is adding a key
since we have the original key handy.
So we''re going to go ahead and start
with the original key in the ignition.
That''s going to give you step-by-step
instructions here.
So, if you see there, it''s basically
checking the security system. Since we
have an original key, it''s going to
bypass the security system. And so, it
did. Then, it''s going to tell you to
turn the ignition off. Then, turn the
ignition on
using the registered key within 17
seconds.
And now it says key programming
succeeded. But basically, if you want to
program the new key, you push yes.
So, what it''s going to do is going to
tell you to remove the original key and
then add the new key into the system.
So, if you can see there, the new key
has been programmed.
Then turn the ignition off. Then turn
the ignition on.
Then turn the ignition off.
Then turn the ignition on.
[Music]
Did the immobilizer light uh remove? And
yes, it did. It was not. Usually the
immobilizer will start blinking if it''s
not removed. But in this case it was
removed. So we went ahead and hit yes it
was removed.
Then if you can see there red key
numbers
number three. It was from two. Now we
added that key. Now it''s number three.
So that''s how we went ahead and
programmed the remote. And there you go.
It starts up the vehicle with no
security light on the dash. This was a
successful programming. If you guys have
any questions or concerns, please leave
me a comment on the on below and I''ll go
ahead and answer them as soon as I can.
Please like and subscribe to my channel.

uh new key and then old key which is
very broken um so just wanted to walk
through this
and show you guys how the
all tell does with honda
so we''re just gonna go through
diagnostics then we''re gonna pick our
car
and we''re gonna go through and pick our
system
usa
so i used to use the varus edge on my
key programs and it did
most of um
most of the system or most of the cars
i''m sorry but um
unfortunately not too long ago i had
a couple acuras that i couldn''t do and i
had already told the customers that i
could do them
and so i called snap-on tech
and come to find out it was they were
still supposed to do it
but there was something wrong with the
software so they had to do an update and
it wouldn''t be fixed into the following
update
so then of course i had to take those
vehicles to um
i had to take before i get going too too
close in here let''s see
oops sorry i''m talking and then just
just walking through this here
um so anyway so yeah so i had to take
him to the dealer spend a couple hours
there pay the dealer to program them
it was a pain so that''s why i got the
im608 because i didn''t want to have to
deal with that
as well as i wanted to be able to do
multiple other keys as well
um so as you saw i went through
diagnostic diagnostics then i went
through system selection
and i chose immobilizer and then it
automatically detects
and then you go into a mobilizer setup
and it''ll load up here it''s pretty easy
and it
the great thing about the im608 is it
walks you through everything
um and honda''s are super easy anyways so
we''re gonna go add delete keys
and then
okay
let it load and we''re gonna add one key
normally you need to read all that stuff
especially if you''re doing something
you''ve never done so
turn the key off turn it back
on we''re gonna turn it off i''m sure and
then pull the key out put the new key in
that''s typically how this works
but i could be wrong because this is
actually the first time i''ve used the
im608
on a honda so
turn it off within 16 seconds okay on
the new key
put our new key in on
oh
on without changing the key
off again i think on one last time i
believe
so it''s real similar to the way
the varus edge did it and then actually
pretty similar to the way
the uh honda hds did as well when i was
at the dealership
um so is it mobilizer turned off
immobilizer light is
turned off so we go yes
turn it off key has been programmed
car starts cool
so we will do that okay off
and one last time
okay we already ensured that it started
the car
and this is the kia
switchblade key no
okay so let''s see sometimes
on these newer ones it actually programs
the lock and unlock
yep so it actually
the hook the hood''s open so it won''t
honk the horn but
you can see program that as well
plus obviously like i said it um
starts the car as well so that''s it it''s
that quick so this video is five minutes
long and you guys saw i uh
was messing around too so it''s super
quick so if you don''t uh have this
in as an option for yourself as
programming keys or as an option in your
shop
i highly recommend it um obviously this
is super easy they''re not all this easy
uh and it can be kind of nerve-wracking
sometimes
but i definitely highly recommend adding
the im608 to your arsenal of
scan tools it''s highly worth it i''ve
done lexus keys
as well already and toyota keys which
are easy as
well and i''m looking forward to jumping
in and doing some more
like ford keys and chevy keys and um i
know that this will actually skip the
uh like i think i forget i think it''s
the 10 minute uh
wait time on the gm''s so
uh that whole process i think it''s 30
minutes in total but you have to
constantly go back out turn the key off
and turn it on every like 10 minutes or
something like that it''s been a while
since i''ve done one but it''ll actually
bypass that
so anyways hopefully you guys liked the
video if you like the content feel free
to check out some of my other videos um
kind of just miscellaneous automotive
stuff so if you''re interested in that
stuff feel free to
subscribe like it if you like it if you
have any questions about the im608 feel
free to reach out i know there''s not a
ton a ton of information
um i can try to give you as much as i
can on my end
um so far there is a function viewer on
it as well which will tell you like
certain vehicles that it''ll do
which is really cool so it''ll go through
i wonder if i can do that real quick no
i''ll have to
exit out let''s see well maybe i can
function viewer
as you can see i''m recording on my phone
all right so you can see i''ve done it in
here a few times
so like uh lincoln so i
you go in and you type in which vehicle
you want and then it tells you like
each one of these what they record what
they um
represent so these symbols over here
and then it tells you what it''ll do
which is really cool
so i thought that was awesome so that
way you can check
before and if a customer calls you is
like hey i have like this customer
called me oops not a passport called me
on the linkedin and said hey i need a
key
i looked it up yes i can add keys no
problem so
that was really cool so awesome thanks

Hello everyone. Today we''ll go over the
step-by-step instructions to add an
additional key using this pro key box
kit. You must have one working key to
add any additional key. This kit is
compatible with many Honda models. I
will add compatibility list at the end
of this video. This kit comes with the
aftermarket key, the programmer tool,
and the instruction manual. If you have
your own unprogrammed key, you can
purchase the programmer separately. This
tool will work on original or
aftermarket key. Today, we''ll program
the aftermarket key with the kit. Once
you use this programmer tool, it will
lock to your car vin. This means you can
reuse it many times in your vehicle, but
you cannot use it in any other vehicle.
So, to begin the process, you need to
connect the tool to the OBD board.
Once you connect it, take the new
unprogrammed key out of the vehicle and
only keep the programmed working key in
the vehicle.
Turn the ignition on, but do not start
the car.
From there, press button B and wait for
the blue light.
[Music]
Then take the working key out of the
vehicle and wait for the yellow light.
Once the yellow is blinking, bring in
the new unprogrammed key into the
vehicle and wait for the red and blue
lights to blink.
Once the red and blue are blinking, turn
the ignition off.
Then turn it back on.
We will repeat this three more times.
At the fourth time, you will hear the
tool long beep indicating the
programming is successful. And now it''s
all done. Your key is ready to go. You
can test your key by starting the
vehicle.
As you can see here, it''s working. Hope
you enjoyed the video. Thank you for

All right, we are on a 2015 Honda Pilot
Touring. We''re doing a remote head key.
This is all keys lost. What I do with
basically all Hond''s except the newer
ones where the remote programs in with
the key, I will um onboard the remote
first to make sure you have the right
one. There''s only one option for this
one, but I did it anyway. I''ll do it
again just to show you how. Um, you turn
the key on to ignition, hit one of the
buttons, back off, on button. You do
that three times, and then it''s going to
cycle the locks. Hit a button on the
remote, turn it off, you''re good to go.
One,
two,
3,
four. There goes the locks. One more to
take my remote back off. So, we know
this remote works. We can go ahead and
program the key.
Um, I do auto propad. Any any programmer
will do these. It''s a pretty easy car. I
just use auto propad because it seems to
get in and read it a little bit quicker.
Do auto search. Ignition is already on.
That is the correct car. We''re on a
blade key.
Switch is still on.
This is why I use auto propad. Um, alt
tell takes a pretty good bit longer to
get that pulled.
We''re going to go to key.
All keys lost.
We''re going to be putting one key in.
Turn ignition off.
Back on. And on the third one, it''s
going to put the immobilizer light out
and we will be good.
Emoite is out. So, we are good to go.
Just got to get back out of programming.
Key registration complete. We''re good to
go. We''re going to turn it off to start
the car up.
Car starts.
It''s already locked.
Did I lose my remote?
That''s funny. I must have taken it back
out. We''ll throw it back in again. On.
Hit the button. Off. On.
Button. Off. On. Button. Off. On. Lock.
Cycle.
There''s my key. Back off. And now we
have remote back. Like I said, I had
already done it and I guess doing it
that second time took it out. But that''s
how you do that. We have working
buttons. Um the hatch on this car
doesn''t work. Uh his buttons don''t work
in the car, so the hatch is not going to
work. But we''re good to go.', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

remote
buttons
okay because this has to be programmed
what they call it onboard programming
sorry I did not actually uh video when
they''re actually doing it but basically
it''s fairly simple now with this
particular model basically you have to
before entering
um
Remote programming mode you have to
cycle
I''ll show you the step four times
instead of four times okay and until you
hear the uh the lock unlock cycle anyway
uh to be exact
basically uh just for demonstration
let''s say this is the your original key
or program key
um meaning that you can start the car
similarly if you have another
program key you have to program this one
as well in terms of you know you cut the
key and then you program the key to
start so they both have to to start the
car okay that''s the first step you have
to program
the key is so they start the car now
let''s say this is original so what you
do to program the remote first step
you will
just know the thing this is the the lock
button okay you''re gonna be pressing
this button you put the key into
ignition in the off position and then
you''re gonna turn it on
a position which is the the two two
lines which is which is on but not all
the way to cranking the engine okay all
right let''s start over you put the key
in
you turned it on to on position and then
you''re gonna press the log key for like
one second
okay and then you''re gonna turn to the
off position
turn it back on again within five
seconds press the lock button again
I''m gonna turn it off again I''m gonna
turn it on again you''re gonna press the
lock button for like one second I''m
gonna turn it off again I''m gonna turn
it on
now once you press this you will hear
the door cycle meaning that it entering
Remote programming mode so on this key
you''re gonna press the lock again for
one second and you should hear the lock
and unlock
and then on the additional key you can
go ahead and press the lock again
okay let''s say you press it for like one
second you should hear the law cycle
again meaning that this remote has been
programmed you have another key you go
ahead and do the same thing just
hold on to that very simple
and then you should hear the the lock
cycle again and you
get the key out of your car and then
test all of your remote and that should
be it
so essentially for this particular car
instead of you do this press button you
do this press button to entering the
programming mode you have to do this for
Cycles if that makes sense
on other models I believe you only do
this two times
one press one press and then
I''ll recycle and then you just press the
lock again blah blah blah if I can
remember but uh you know I was a little
confused at the beginning because based
on instruction
you only do this two times before
entering the programming mode anyway I
think in short you have any questions
let me know sorry I cannot do the actual
programming for you but uh also somebody
mentioned or someone if you have a on on
your key if you do have a tongue opening
you have to hold to test it you have to
hold the tongue opening for like 10
seconds
and then the trunk should open as well

Hello everyone. Today we''ll go over the
step-by-step instructions to add an
additional key using this pro key box
kit. You must have one working key to
add any additional key. This kit is
compatible with many Honda models. I
will add compatibility list at the end
of this video. This kit comes with the
aftermarket key, the programmer tool,
and the instruction manual. If you have
your own unprogrammed key, you can
purchase the programmer separately. This
tool will work on original or
aftermarket key. Today, we''ll program
the aftermarket key with the kit. Once
you use this programmer tool, it will
lock to your car vin. This means you can
reuse it many times in your vehicle, but
you cannot use it in any other vehicle.
So, to begin the process, you need to
connect the tool to the OBD board.
Once you connect it, take the new
unprogrammed key out of the vehicle and
only keep the programmed working key in
the vehicle.
Turn the ignition on, but do not start
the car.
From there, press button B and wait for
the blue light.
[Music]
Then take the working key out of the
vehicle and wait for the yellow light.
Once the yellow is blinking, bring in
the new unprogrammed key into the
vehicle and wait for the red and blue
lights to blink.
Once the red and blue are blinking, turn
the ignition off.
Then turn it back on.
We will repeat this three more times.
At the fourth time, you will hear the
tool long beep indicating the
programming is successful. And now it''s
all done. Your key is ready to go. You
can test your key by starting the
vehicle.
As you can see here, it''s working. Hope
you enjoyed the video. Thank you for

locksmith and while I definitely don''t
know it all, I have learned some tricks
along the way that I hope will help you
while you''re out in the field. One thing
you can do to help me out though would
be to subscribe to my channel. And if
you like my videos, leave a comment or
ask a question and I''ll get back to you
as soon as I can. I make a lot of
videos, so if there''s something you''d
like to learn more about or a video
you''d like to see on a car we''re working
on, just let me know in the comments and
I''ll put it up as soon as I can. Thanks,
and I hope you enjoy watching my videos.
&gt;&gt; All right, good morning. Um, I''ve seen
all the comments. What does Ron look
like? Why do we only see the back of his
head? All right, that''s not what
happened, but here I am. Hi. Um, we are
doing a
Hyundai Elantre. We''re adding a prox
key.
I did the automatic select or yeah,
automatic selection. Read the car. Here
is the new key. It is the F2000
from Noble Key Supply. We''re going to go
smart key.
This is a 2017, so I can''t use the
dongle to get the PIN and the key code.
So, we''re going to have to read it from
the car.
Read a Mobilizer password.
Reading this pin can take quite a while.
Uh, knowing which one of these to select
cuts it down. This is an 8A. I read the
Yes. Turn the hazard lights on.
Turn the ignition off. Open and close
the door.
So, this does this, like I said, this
can take a pretty good while. So, I''m
going to pause this here. go duplicate
his key and come back hopefully with the
password.
We are back. There''s my password. That
took a good five minutes. 195515.
So, we''re going to go back
to keyless system
remote control learning. It''s going to
give me the message that I need to put
both keys back in when we get in there.
Smart key learning.
There it is. We''ll erase all existing
keys. It''s just saying you got to
program the original key back if you''re
going to lose it.
All that is done.
5515.
All right. Hit okay. Push the button
with the key
this down here so we can see the lights
and cover up the other key.
All right.
Okay, push the button. Launch your
security lights. I don''t know why it
said that. Never does that. Programming
succeeded. Would you like to program the
next one? Yes, I would. Same process.
Hit okay.
Hold the button down. That''s going to
say programming succeeded. Number of
keys, two. Please exit the system. Uh
the limit on Hyundai Kia is two keys,
strangely. So that''s all you can do. So,
that''s that. And we are done here. We''re
going to test these remotes. This
battery is dead. I''ll change that for
him.
Mine
garbage truck. Start it up.
Good to go.

Cafe. We are going to add a key.
Initially, customer thought that this
key wasn''t
working. Um I told them that it could be
a battery problem. So, I came on site
and uh checked. Sure enough, it was just
a battery problem. So, instead of a all
keys lost, we''re just going to have to
add a key. So pretty quickly we are
going to switch the ignition on is that
key here. We are going to attempt to add
a uh an aftermarket key to it. Uh this
Hyundai Santa Fe have
uh keys that works on two different
frequency. Some of them work on 433 MHz
and some work on 350. This vehicle is
the one that works on the 315 MHz. I do
have two aftermarket keys here. Uh
Hyundai''s vehicle are a little picky
about, you know, programming keys.
Sometimes they refuse aftermarket keys,
but I do trust this supplier. They
usually provide very good keys even
aftermarket. So, I''m going to try to add
this to the system. So, real quick, what
we''re going to do is uh to identify the
vehicle. Uh I already have the Wi-Fi
turned on. We are going to click on this
and uh type Hyundai and we have Hyundai
here. I wanted to start with Lounor but
uh KM100 is pretty good at identifying
Hyundai''s and Kia is pretty quick. Uh
the only issue I have with KM100 is uh
the time it takes to read the password.
So, let''s try and find out. Uh
uh I do want to point out that the B the
the customer''s battery
uh in the car is really low. Matter of
fact, the vehicle wouldn''t start at
first. So now, actually, this is a
2015, but this key covers 2013 to 2017.
So, this is a smart key.
Okay. So, we are going to go into
control unit keyless radioizer password.
This is a ID8A ship. Let''s try to do
that. Okay. Click on okay. Turn the
hazard
on. It''s pretty hot in here. I was
hoping for the AC to be working, but
it''s not working. It is normal. If the
ignition, if the instrument cluster turn
black, no worries. Uh, we open and close
the driver door right
now. And then we are going to click on
okay to start the
procedure.
Uh, it claims that the key is not into
the vehicle. For some reason, it didn''t
detect it, but now it seems like
everything is okay. So, excuse the
glare, but this is the only spot that I
have to work. So, I''m just going to have
to do with
it. Password. I''m going to try to put a
uh
stopwatch just so I can
uh I can have an idea how long it took
me to read that
password
clock stopwatch on. We''ve been in this
process for already 1 minute. So, at the
end, we''re just going to total this up
and find out how long it took. If it
reads the password, if KM 100 is taking
too long to read the password, I''m going
to try to disconnect the battery and uh
reconnect it. If that doesn''t work, I''m
just going to use Lawn Door because by
experience, Lonesor is faster than
KM100 in my experience. We now have a
password. Remember we had uh been
looking for about 1 minute and plus the
countdown right now is 218. So all
together 3 minutes and uh 30 seconds. So
that''s not too bad. So we are going to
go into the add key function.
So we are going to get out of
this function and then we are going to
go into keyless and remote control
learning. Okay, smart key
learning. I''m going to say yes.
Turn the hazard light on. It''s already
turned on. Open and close the driver''s
door. Not going to do that. Just going
to click on
okay. Okay. I''m supposed to turn the
ignition
off. So, we are going to start this
again. Smart key
learning. Click on okay.
Okay. So, it will populate the password
immediately and we''ll just click on
okay. It will verify the password. If
you enter the password three times
wrong, it will lock the vehicle. So now
is the right time to program the key.
Once we click on okay, we have 5 seconds
to put the the head of the key on the to
contact the head of the key on the
buttons. Then the security light should
come on and go off. It means that it
will it will be programmed and it would
show on the screen that the key is
programmed. So we''re going to repeat
this procedure for the aftermarket key
and hopefully our aftermarket key is
good and everything will be great. So
let''s go ahead and click on
okay and
then and this worked for this
key. Remember on Hyundai Kia you have to
reprogram the original key otherwise the
key that is not programmed will be
disabled. So I''m going to say yes and do
the same thing again. I will leave that
key in the bag just in case that doesn''t
work. Click okay and contact the group.
Okay, so this worked as well. It say
programming succeed. Two keys registered
into the system. Now we are going to say
okay and test the keys.
All right. So now this is our new key.
Let''s go ahead and test it. It works.
Unlocks. Perfect. Let''s take the
original
key. Lock. Unlock. Everything is
perfect. Now let''s start the
vehicle. Vehicle starts. No problem.
And this is how you program a uh smart
key for a Hyundai
uh Santa Fe 2013 to 2017. Thanks for

you guys for watching on another
episode. What we''re working on today,
it''s going to be a 2012 Hyundai Sonata.
So, what we''re doing here, we''re using
the Xorse cutting machine, going to the
Hyundai section and actually pulling up
the key. This one has like kind of a
special key that you have to pull up the
information to cut it. It''s like the
inner type key that um Hyundai has,
Toyota has. So you''ll see the type of
key that I''m talking about. So if you
can see there, generation, we''re going
by the year. Then it tells you on what
uh what line to put it on. This is going
to be in the number one line. So if you
can see there, um that''s the A section,
but if you flip it over, it''s going to
be the B section. And it tells you on
your screen which one it wants. So if
you can see that type of key, it''s going
to go ahead and uh measure it out and
trace it. and then get the actual key
cut. And then I''ll start cutting the
actual key once I put a blade in there.
So that''s my new blade. This is the new
uh blade number 77 for a flip key. So
here we''re going to go ahead and connect
to the OBD2.
And in this case, we''re just actually
programming a remote, which is going to
be OBD2 because these Hyundai, most of
them don''t have any chips. So you don''t
need to program anything. You just cut a
key and put a you you know, put a shell
and then turn the turn the ignition and
it''ll turn it on because it doesn''t need
a transponder ID. So, here we''re just
going to program the remote. I like to
turn off the radio, the AC just to not
uh drain the battery because once your
battery is drained, it starts giving you
problems.
So, here we have the ignition on and
we''re going to do an auto VIN.
Now, these Xorse keys have been
generated for this Hyundai, for this
Hyundai uh Sonata specifically, so they
will work only with this vehicle.
Now, you do have to have that hot spot
on and have some signal there. If you
can see, the VIN number did pop up. So,
it did extract the data. And now we''re
going to go ahead and go to
Well,
here we''re going to check on the tag. If
it was made in the USA, Europe, or
anywhere else here, it''s going to be the
USA. It''s going to be a blade key.
Then we''re going to go to control unit
and then go ahead and hit remote learn
remote control learning.
And then once it enters into the system,
it''s going to give you basic
instructions of what to do.
So it''s telling you turn the ignition on
and off. So we''re going to turn it off
and then take out the key. and then go
ahead and activate the programming mode
and hit the lock. And if you can see
there, programming has been successful.
Here we''re doing two keys for the
customer. So that''s a second remote that
has been successful.
And then from there, we start testing
the remotes out. See if they''re fully
functioning. And if you could see there,
they are working properly. And we have a
complete key. Once we go ahead and mount
the blade and put the logo on there and
we have two successful keys that we''ve
sold. Thank you guys so much. If you
guys have any questions, please leave a
comment below and I''ll go ahead and get
back to you as soon as I can. Have a
good one.', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

Your customer is asking for a new car
key. It happens all the time. They lost
it, dropped it in the sewer, or just
want new ones for their spouse or
children.
Autel has your professional level key
programmer to support any car in any
situation. The combination of key
programming and vehicle diagnostics
coverage in one tool ensures that you
will be able to complete the project the
first time. In this video, we''re going
to unbox the IM 608 Pro and take a look
at the included parts. If you''re
familiar with all the parts and just
want a demonstration of use in different
situations, Autel has a library of
vehicle specific how-to videos for your
reference anytime. And they include key
learning with the OBD and the XP400 Pro
unit. So, let''s open the case and see
what''s included.
The IM 608 comes with cables for the VCI
and XP400 Pro to use with the tablet
here, which is light and durable for
shop use.
So, let''s power it on and see what the
features are like. Also, make sure you
register your tool to your free Autel ID
account and update the tool software.
You''ll see IMO on the left, which
includes all the steps we recommend you
take. If you just want to do key
programming or diagnostics, you can do
that pretty quickly from this home
screen. The great advantage of the Autel
IM 608 Pro is the combination of key
programming, advanced diagnostics, and
maintenance service in one tool. So, you
can easily select different options from
these screens.
On the second screen, you can have help
from the Autel tech support team or
another professional remotely log in and
help you out if you''re having trouble.
Data manager here helps you store and
view all your data. Shop manager for
vehicle history and workshop
information.
VCI manager to help you connect to the
VCI.
Function viewer to look up functions.
Digital inspection if you want to
connect a camera. And finally,
microscope to use your oscilloscope.
This is the J2534,
which is the VCI or vehicle
communication interface that you will
use to wirelessly connect the tablet
with your vehicle''s OBD port. For some
car models, you can use the VCI directly
to learn new keys. A lot of newer models
also need the included key programmer.
So, this is the XP400 Pro key
programmer. And essentially, the only
difference between an IM 608 Pro models
is that this programmer has more ports
for advanced use, depending on what
vehicles and functions you want to
complete. The XP400 Pro can program even
more EROM and MCU chip types than the
XP400. Purchase the key programming
adapter kit, the IMKPA, to expand the
XP400 Pros capability and program BMW
EWS3 keys and Mercedes-Benz any NEC
keys.
Now, you may be wondering, when should I
use the programmer and when should I
only use the VCI?
The answer is it depends. It all depends
on the vehicle making model. Great
benefit is you don''t need to worry about
making that decision. The IM 608
software will correctly identify the
vehicle model and during the key
programming procedure selection, the
software will confirm exactly which
units to use to complete the procedure
and provide step-by-step instructions of
how to complete it. If you have any
questions during this process, you can
contact the OTEL tech support team to
ask questions. We are always happy to
help support you and your team. If
you''re using the XP400 Pro key
programmer, you need to connect this
cable with the tablet. If you''re using
the VCI to connect to the vehicle, you
need to use this OBD2 cable. In
addition, remember, never connect the
J2534 unit to the XP 400 Pro key
programmer using the OBD2 cable. Please
read all setup instructions and follow
these and all tablet displayed
programming instructions carefully. Your
tablet should wirelessly connect by
Bluetooth to the VCI, but if for
whatever reason there''s an issue, you
can use this USB cable to connect the
tablet with the VCI. Finally, we have
several chips included in the case.
These are for the advanced programming
situations and require professionally
trained locksmith use. The Autel
software reads the vehicle data from
multiple modules to confirm the system
encoding matches and displays it all on
the tablet. So after collision repairs,
if the system modules have been replaced
without proper coding or programming
into the vehicle system, the vehicle
security will not allow the key
programming to proceed. Technicians
first need to complete the necessary
repairs to allow the vehicle system
security access. This is why Autel
recommends only skilled professionals
operate the IM 608 to complete repairs.
But this is again what makes the IM 608
such an amazing tool to provide both key
programming and advanced diagnostics in
one. So all levels of vehicle repair can
be completed from one tablet. Let''s tap
IMO which will take you through the
whole process.
Make sure you''re connected to an
internet source for this.
You can auto scan your VIN to get the
car''s info as that will make the setup
easy.
If you can''t get the VIN automatically,
find the car model and tap it.
You''ll see automatic selection and
manual selection. Automatic selection
will take you step by step through the
process. You can use diagnostics and key
programming straight from the home
screen. Now, function viewer will tell
you exactly what your car''s model can
do.
Tap it, then select your tablet in the
top left.
Your tablet is the IM 608.
If you''re using the IM508 and select
508,
then select the car''s make, model, and
year.
After it loads, you''ll see a lot of
symbols.
You can see what these symbols mean by
tapping the question mark in the top
right corner.
So, here BMW 8 series, we got some
square boxes.
It means you can make new keys using the
onbench method or in other words, using
the XP 400 Pro. My name is Mike and I

so you know how to add a new key for a
car like the Honda Accord that only
requires a VCI connection but what if
all keys are lost well luckily the
process is just as simple as adding a
new key I''ll take you through the
process step by step so let''s get
started on this vehicle I will be using
the I M 608 Pro connect the cable to the
JVC then connect the other end of the
cable to the OBD2 port in the
vehicle establish a Bluetooth connection
to the JVC on your tablet these are the
only pieces of equipment you''ll need for
this process you do not need the XP 400
Pro for this car so on your tablet tap
immo and find your car we can scan the V
automatically or find your car Honda and
input it manually in this case we are
working with a Honda 2020 Accord and the
key is a smart key push to
start next we can do a system check to
make sure everything is working normally
this will do a system scan of all
modules that affect the keys and
security
the scan comes up normal so let''s select
all keys lost guided
we need to turn the ignition on and off
a few times follow the prompts on the
screen we have to make sure one original
key is in the
car is this a new model newer than 2020
yes so now we can see that a key has
been added successfully
now once it''s successful we need to
synchronize the key information with the
car we do this by turning the ignition
on and off a few times
okay so we have successfully added a key
with all keys lost now we can check to
make sure if the key works by turning
the car on or unlocking and locking the
doors so let''s do that real
quick now that we''re finished we can go
back to imemo learning and check to see
how many keys we have have we can delete
some keys add a key and check key
information my name is Mike and that''s
all for the Honda Accord the process
takes less than 5 minutes if you''re
interested in learning all about Keys
lost for Mercedes check out our other
video in this series and if you have any

functions
for configuration of computers and
a lot of service that you can you can do
it with this one

it it is a bridge between immobilizer
system
program service and diagnosis
right now i''m gonna put the hazard on

because the battery is dead this car is
parked for a long time
this is the key we have a power pack
we''re gonna take this one here put it
onto the positive side
of the car and you''re gonna take the
other one
put it to the negative side you see it''s
already started sparking
this one here if you want to test it
you see it''s red but if you push here

to do the other work in our 88 person
please subscribe share and like
you have a question feel free to ask now
i need to do another one i''m going to go
to star 2.
diagnose this one will prepare
the system for you the bcm is not
communicating or you have a fault
because you have a fault it becomes
orange
but if it''s if it''s like orange it''s not
coming
this color is no communication but if
it is like this is fault there''s a fault
in it
so this color is like like more not like
red
so that mean is communicating after 57
percent after 100 percent
we have two two-way add add a key
guideline
or all key loss guided guided means it
will tell you step by step
here we have the bcm number you see this
one
one for echo zero f you can take this
one here
convert it to a number i believe
and then that number will tell you what
what you''re gonna do
it you''re gonna put it in a place but
this guy will do the calculation and you
do the bypass
if you''re using dealer tools you must
have another calculator outside
so this is the advantage between the
dealer tools
and the locksmith tools which means a
locksmith will have more advantage and
save your time and money
in some jobs but for some cars if you
don''t have the dealer tool you can shut
off the
shut down the whole system so i''m gonna
go all key lost
how many step i have three step get the
pin i''m gonna click
start when i click the start

a key into the system pretty much we
have to reprogram the key so
programming or adding keys for Nissan
Infinities all the same because
um you have to do the same procedure
so we''re going to go to G37 sedan
let the machine read the car''s
information
foreign
hooked up into the vehicle''s OBD right
there
hazard lights are on
and the older Nissan Infinities they all
have slots so we''re going to insert this
into the slots
and we''re going to go to Smart Key
learning
it''s telling us that all keys will be
erased
insert intelligent key into the slots
and turn the ignition on
power
it''s communicating right now
so we will need to turn it off and back
on for the programming to go through
and here is the security light indicator
telling us that it''s going well so we''re
going to turn it off and then insert all
the keys that we need to program
into the system
here let''s blinking again which is a
good sign
and we have one more key
a total of three keys to add on
and we are complete once we''re done
check out the key and put in the first
key
close out the programming procedure

it is not working as you guys see it''s
kind of a bad key it''s dead but I was
just using my old my own personal cars
key to program it just to get my my
friend uh to uh see if the car is the
problem where the key is so it turned
out to be the key so anyways let''s go to
immo so first of all you got to connect
your uh Maxi flash or if you''re using a
programmer tablet like the km 100 which
will do the work just fine just connect
the VCI right there in OBD port and it
should read it so I''m going to go ahead

the hazards
and we''re going to open and close the
driver turn on the ignition condition
cannot be turned on it can be but in
your case let''s just see it cannot so
click on
okay okay so the system is done loading
so let''s go to hot functions you don''t
need to go to IMO status whatever it is
if you have BCM codes actually why not
I''m just going to show you click on IMO
status it''s going to scan make sure that
the BCM doesn''t have any St stupid codes
or something that''s going to prevent it
from registering a key so as guys can
see number of registered Keys is blah
blah blah right here it''s number one uh
encrypted code this is the code for this
specific
BCM so I''m just going to wait until it''s
done at 87 uh

while come
on cool we''re done so I''m going to go
ahead and you can access it from here it
doesn''t really matter but I''m going to

more of a thorough guide on how to do
the Infiniti QX60. It''s a 2016 and this
is going to apply for like the the 14
through 19 Prox buttons. Uh if you have
other questions about the Infinities,
check out the links below. But let''s get
started. So, we want to be super
thorough. So, we have key one, key2, our
smart pro. Let''s make sure the vehicle
starts. So, we turn it on. Great. Let''s
make sure that sensor works. Not just
trust the proximity, but let''s make sure
the key works with that sensor as a dead
battery test. So, I open up the working
key and I''m going to leave it here and
I''m going to brake pedal. Push button
and it''ll say no key detected. Great.
Now, I''m going to brake pedal in
and it starts up. Good. Let''s go ahead
and turn it off. Put it there. Double
check. Doesn''t turn on. And let''s double
check again.
Great. So now we know the proximity
works, the buttons work, the sensor
works. Let''s go ahead and start the
programming process. The reason why that
sensor doesn''t work, you delete the
keys, you can''t add them back in, and
you are stranded with a bricked vehicle.
Now it''s back and assembled. We have one
working key and one non-programmed key.
Let''s go and get started. So, we''re
looking at QX60 14 through 19.
We''re going to connect
switch off hazards on.
Go to program keys.
Use the lock button.
And we have key one, key two, three, and
four. If we had multiple keys,
this where it deletes everything.
Good. Let''s check.
Cool. It turns on. Good. And now it''s
checking the proximity.
Okay. And we turn off.
Okay.
of the first prox one.
And I''m going to good angle like this.
And I''m not holding the buttons. I''m
going to hold like this. One. Two.
And you see it flash. Great.
And I keep it there. I''m going to pull
away. It flashed. I''m going to turn off.
Okay. Put it back. You want to program
more keys? Yes.
of the next procs. This one. Same thing.
One, two.
You see it flash five times. Great.
Off.
Do you want to program more keys? No.
Of key one. Key one.
And I''m going to press one, two.
That audible beep means it''s finished.
Complete. Good.
And
cool.
Nice.
Cool.
Trunk is open. Cool. Now we''re just
going to cut the key and then we''re good
to go. Other than that, thanks for
watching and I will see you next time.
See you. Bye.
[Applause]

out.
Let''s check the key inserts. So, we have
the original key. It''s kind of dirty.
Smooth. Let''s switch to the new key.

done. Make sure you check out the

i''m not sure about the infinity but
let''s try
11.99 hopefully it''s good if it''s not

also the uh the blade to open the door

mechanical key but let me show you
really quick that this key is not

right so what you have to do well you
need the special equipment for this
we''re going to use the autofix uh today
basically it''s like an AEL uh scanner
im608 basically and well the first thing
we have to do is read the PIN code but
before even doing all this you need a
special account which is called the auto
off to be able to unlock the camway
otherwise you have to disassemble a
radio and do bypass on the cboy module
using a special
adapter but I have that account so I
don''t have to disassemble anything and
well I''m going to read the PIN code
right
now
and uh the ignition is off and just
going to turn the hazards on and it will
automatically read the PIN code
um I have a b subscription for this also
you need a b subscription uh if you''re a
locksmith then you will understand if
regular people like you watching this
well I''m really sorry but you have to
take this card to a dealership or a
locksm because these cars are becoming
more and more difficult to be able to
program a key because uh reasons of
stealing and all that and that''s why
it''s all like that so I''m just going to
wait for this tool to so I''m just going
to wait for this tool to give me the PIN
code and then we''re going to go ahead
and start the programming process on
this thing people so we got the password
and well I had to use the adapter
because it was not allowing me to do it
unlocking the camway so I just have to
remove the Gateway module which is
behind this thing going to show you got
to remove the 8 mm bolts holding it this
thing sits right here like that
the connections are right there this is
the adapter I''ll leave the link in the
description if you want to buy that that
adapter and well I would recommend you
to do it because it''s not going to work
out if you just do the uh the gway
unlock all

Okay, I have a 2012 Jeep Compass
or I''m sorry, 2020 Jeep Compass Proxy
Key. So, we''re obviously looking for a
12 plus 8 or star connector. Took the
world apart. Looking for a star. It''s
not behind the radio. It''s not on the
passenger side. It''s not under here. Um,
there is a 12 plus 8 way up above the
brake pedal. Uh, finally found that and
then found that. don''t have my 12 plus 8
on me. I gave it to my other guy last
week. But
for those of you that have the Smart Pro
and don''t know
what the other side of the uh or this
it''s a what is it? 2012 connector. It is
for the RFH hub which on this compass is
in the rear deck um
under the headliner.
Grab my Smart Pro and put it on the
charge for a minute. Make sure I don''t
die in the middle of this.
Just get this hooked up. Give me a sec
here.
So, yeah, here we are in the trunk.
Sorry, fumbling a little bit. It is
200°.

And then I believe we''re going to go up
front. Push the buttons.
All right. Place Prox Fobic near the

press and release lock button once.

Come on.
There it is. Got it. Yay.

All right, we''re good to go. Program
that key. And this is the compass. So,
it is the uh
what do you call it?
The key with the uh the SIP 22 blade

looking at, just look for the SIP 22

additional key using this Pro key box
kit to begin you must have one working
key to add any additional key this kit
is compatible with 2018 to 2013 Jeep
Grand Cherokee if you want to know
whether your car makes this list I will
cover what cars do and don''t at the end
of this video this kit comes with the
aftermarket key the programmer tool and
the instruction manual if you have your
own unprogrammed key you can also
purchase the programmer tool separately
as an alternative option to save
money this tool will work on any
aftermarket key or the original
key today we''ll program the aftermarket
key with the kit first then we will use
the kit to program our own unprogrammed
original Dodge key
once you use this programmer tool it
will lock to your car Vin this means you
can reuse it as many times as you want
in your vehicle but you cannot use it in
any other vehicle for safety reasons so
to begin the process you need to connect
the tool to the OBD
board once you connect you can insert
the original key that is already
programmed into the ignition and turn it
to the on position do not start the car
from there the tool will show the models
to select from select the model of your
car in my case it is Ram then on the
next screen choose 1500 next press enter
and choose the year of your car make so
we''re working on the 2011 Ram
1500 it will give you a range so I
choose from 2009 to 2012

brake and start the vehicle so press the
brake and start your vehicle to get to
the next
step now it will be connecting to your
vehicle once it says turn the ignition
off and remove the key turn the ignition
off and remove the key

key so insert it into the ignition and
turn it to the on position but do not
start the
car within a few seconds here you will
hear the tool beep and now it''s all done
your key is ready to go you can test
your key by starting the vehicle as you
can see here it''s working now in our
case we will also program the second key
to do this we will repeat the
steps start by shutting the car
off and then unplug the pro key box
[Music]
tool here we will repeat the same step
except we will use the new key we just
programmed to program the second key so
again insert the key and turn it to the
on position then choose your model of
car and the year for me it is Ram 1500
the year 2009 to
2012 now press enter and it will tell
you again to press the brake and start
the
vehicle next press
enter and let it connect until it tells
you to to turn the ignition off then
once it does remove the key and turn the
vehicle off here is our next
unprogrammed original Dodge
key repeating the same steps as before
insert the key into the ignition and
turn it to the on position do not start

smart key system with RFID technology.
Programming a new key fob involves
teaching the vehicle''s body control
module to recognize it. The key fob
contains a transponder chip and buttons
for lock, unlock, panic, and trunk
release. The BCM can pair with up to
eight keys. There are a few ways to do
this. Keep in mind that enhanced
security protocols post 2020 may make
DIY attempts harder, and encrypted keys
often require dealer tools. As of 2025,
all 2011 models are eligible for free
security updates at the dealer, which
includes the key fob programming. For
non-encrypted keys, a standard DIY
method exists. Insert a working key into
the ignition, then cycle the ignition.
Turn the key to on, then run, then off.
Press the new key fob buttons in
sequence to program it. Ensure your
vehicle battery is above 12 volts and
there are no active security faults.
Success rates are higher for basic fobs
than aftermarket ones. Encrypted keys,
common in 2011 models, typically require
a dealer tool due to BCM security codes.
Attempting to force programming can
trigger a lockout. Remember, post2020
security updates may impact DIY success.
If unsuccessful, a dealer visit is
recommended. Also be aware that users
report occasional glitches with cold
weather affecting signal strength and
increased complaints about battery life,

particular simple key works for a
variety of models from Chrysler Dodge
and Jeep but today we will just be going
over the Jeep Vehicles listed on the
back here you can see that''s the
commander 2006 to 2009 Compass 07 to17
Grand Cherokee 05 to 07 Liberty 08 to 12
Wrangler 07 to8
if you are looking for a jeep that is
not listed here on the back we should
have another another video for you on
this channel um and there are also
videos for these chrys learn Dodge
vehicles listed that is a separate video
because the process is a little bit
different and if you''re looking for a
different um make entirely just go check
out our Channel we should have you
covered there are tons of these simple
keys that match up with almost every
making model out there so let''s just get
this started this is a quick and easy
process um it''ll save you a ton of money
compared to doing it at the
dealership so inside we have the easy
installer a new key that we will be
programming and the user
guide the first thing you want to do is
check the seal on the easy installer
this is actually a part that will we
will plug into your car in a little bit
if this says void or it is missing or
damaged you''ll want to take this whole
thing back to the retailer where you got
it and get yourself a new one because if
this is uh removed it has probably been
used on another car and once you use it
on a vehicle it will be paired with that
vehicle and it will not work with other
vehicles so make sure that that is good
to go you will need to get this physical
key cut before you start the process you
can do that at your local hardware store
and you will need to have your working
key the one that you currently use with
your your vehicle with you to get this
done and one more thing worth mentioning
is that your new key will only have the
functions um that your old key had so as
you can see I have the same key over
here but it doesn''t have the trunk
button if this is the the key I
currently use with my vehicle I can
still program this new key but this
button won''t work that''s just how it
goes you can''t add new functions to your
key in this
process now the first step is activating
our new key fob uh go ahead and look on
screen now I will show you a chart with
all of the different um activation codes
just find the key fob the picture of the
key fob that you currently use and look
down that column and make sure that the
um model and year of your vehicle is
there and reference that uh activation
code right there just write it down or
remember it it''s just a three-digit code
um and then we can move on to punch that
into your new key
now I''m going to show you another image
here if you use the three button key fob
pictured in the bottom right and your
vehicle''s model and year is listed there
at the top you''ll want to flip your key
over to the back the original working
key that you have and check the FCC ID
if the FCC ID matches the one on screen
you''ll want to forget the code that you
saw on the previous image and use the
code 233 this only applies to those view
that have the three button key fob and
the models and years listed on this
image okay now I''ll show you how to get
this done what we want to do is take our
new key and first press lock and panic
simultaneously this light will come on
and stay on which means we can now punch
in our activation code I will show you
231 so I''ll um put in the first digit
with the lock button second panic and
Third unlock
press twice for two one two 3 and one so
now I''ve punched in 2 3 1 I will press
lock and panic once again and this light
should blink back our
code one two pause one 2 3 pause one so
that means you''re good to go onto the
next step but if for example you try to
punch in your code and you see this
blinking that just means that it''s not
recognizing the code you can keep trying
this process um until it works there''s
no um problem if you have to try many
times but once we move on to the next
step which is pairing you will never
want to try to activate your key again
because that will cause it not to work
so let me just show you one more time
this time I''ll show you 2 three
three twice on the lock
button three times on
Panic three times on unlock and now
simultaneously lock and panic
one two pause one two 3 pause one two 3
there we go once you have that punched
in you can move on to the next step so
grab your easy installer your new key
your old key the one that works with
your vehicle uh your user guide and go
ahead and hop in your vehicle the first
thing we want to do is locate the OBD
Port you can see on screen an image of
an OBD Port that''s what it looks like
it''s usually under the dash almost down
at the level of the pedals so go check
under there see if you can find it if
not check your owner''s manual uh that
comes with your car and that information
should be in there once you have that
located take everything that I just
mentioned get in the vehicle close all
of the doors make sure the car is off in
park and put your hazard lights
on now we''ll set the dial position
position of the easy installer so come
over here and set your dial position to
one if it''s on one just leave it there
if not set it to one all of the models
and years for this particular simple key
use one so don''t worry about it the only
exception there is those that have a
Jeep Grand Cherokee you''ll want to try
the pairing process that I''m about to
show you with the dial position on one
first and if that doesn''t work you''ll
set it to two and I''ll uh talk more on
that in a little bit but once you have
this set to one you can take your
original working key insert it in turn
the vehicle on start the
engine can come over now remove the seal
on your easy
installer just tear that off and insert
it into the OBD Port once this is
plugged in we''ll have about 5 minutes to
work before the computer of your vehicle
times out um the the whole process will
just take you a minute but it''s just
good to be aware that you''ll need to
work at a steady Pace to get this done
if you wait longer than 5 minutes this
will start to beep and you''ll just need
to unplug it and start this process
again so once you plug that in it''s go
time and you have to follow these next
steps carefully once the easy installer
is plugged into the OBD Port all you''ll
want to do is wait up to 8 seconds and
listen for three quick beeps which
sounds like this that means that your
vehicle has recognized that we''re
starting the pairing process and you can
move on to the next step if you hear a
different type of beeping sound then
you''ll want to skip ahead to the end of
the video where I go over the errors
that you can run into and how to fix
them once you''ve heard the three beeps
you can now turn off your vehicle remove
the old key insert your new key into the
ignition and turn it to the on or run
position do not start the engine you''ll
want to turn turn it to the final
position before starting the
engine now look over here in the easy
installer there''s a button right up on
top press that once once you''ve pressed
it wait up to 8 seconds and listen for
three quick beeps which again sounds
like
this once you''ve heard that uh you are
pretty much finished all you want to do
is remove the new key take it out no key
in the ignition vehicle off and press
this button one more time
you should hear a chime sound coming
from the easy installer which sounds
like this and if you hear that that
means you''re finished and your new key
is paired to your vehicle and you''ll
just want to unplug this from the OBD
port and go ahead and test your keys
your new and your old key should both
work they will both be paired with your
vehicle and you can actually continue
this process to pair a total of eight
keys to your vehicle so if you had
another new key um cut and ready to to
go that you wanted to pair with your
vehicle you can use the same easy
installer and just follow the um the
process that I just showed you again for
a total of eight
Keys now I will quickly go over some of
the errors that you can run into all
this information is available in your
user
guide starts over on page 11 so if the
easy installer BL uh beeps eight times
after pushing the button to initiate the
pairing process
that means that Eight Keys have already
been paired to your vehicle and you will
not be able to pair another as I
mentioned um there''s a maximum of eight
keys that you can have paired to your
vehicle and so this will not work and
their solution is to contact them at
their customer service number which you
can see right there and also I just want
to point out that over on page 13 you
can find their um their customer service
number it''s asking here can I use the
easy installer the same easy installer
on other vehicles no you cannot once you
plug this in um it will be paired to
your vehicle and it will not work on
other
vehicles if the easy installer sounds
two or three beeps at 1 second intervals
three times and then beeps continuously
uh this can mean one of are two
different errors there so the two beeps
means that the device has already been
used on another vehicle just another way
of saying that um it will not work
and if you''re hearing three distinct
beeps at 1 second intervals this means
that your working key your old key
that''s currently paired to your vehicle
is not present it needs to be close by
in the car with you so that it can
detect the key and uh you can continue
with the process so just go ahead and
grab your key and make sure that it is
close
by here it says simply the new key won''t
pair to my car usually the error is that
um it is an incorrect dial position so
all of all of the models and years for
Jeep use the dial position one except
for the J Grand Cherokee which should
work with one but if it doesn''t you''ll
want to switch this over to two and
start the pairing process from zero so
turn off your vehicle remove all of the
keys close your doors put it in park
hazard lights on and start the pairing
process again with dial position two and
that should get you sorted
out the easy installer was unplugged
during the pairing process what do you
do well it''s no problem um you''ll just
need to start the pairing process again
uh you can''t continue from where you
left off when you unplugged it you''ll
need to start a fresh pairing process so
as I mentioned um in the previous
frequently Asked question you''ll just un
uh you remove all of the keys from your
vehicle make sure it''s off in park doors
closed and start again and you shouldn''t
have any problems you can just keep
trying that process again and again
until you get it
right and it says if the vehicle won''t
start with the new or the old key after
attempting to pair that is some kind of
an error that you''ve run into and their
solution is just to give them a call
over at that number which again is on
page 13 in this book If you prefer
to um just reference their own chart all
of that information that I gave you on
um the activation codes and the dial
position is listed right in here for
Jeep that''s page six six and seven so
that''s the whole process as I mentioned
if you wanted you could just keep going
and pairing uh more um keys to your
vehicle and this will continue to work
with your vehicle but it will not work
with others so I hope this video was
easy enough to follow I hope it helped
you out and I hope you saved a ton of
money doing this process at home
compared to doing it at the dealership

show you how you can save money if you
need to get another key for your car now
in the olden days between 1994 there are
just simple keys then we''re caught you
could go to hardware store and get one
made for a couple of bucks
but that''s not the case anymore this
newer Toyota has a key that you can open
the doors and things with and it''s got
an immobilizer chip inside so it will
only start if it has the chip and some
modern keys like this one for a 2015
Chrysler you don''t have a key it''s a
remote that you just walk in the car
with and you push your button to start
the car these things can cost a lot of
money if they break or you lose them so
as you as you want to show you how to
save money if you have one that has an
immobilizer chip and has box that open
and close it you can go ahead and buy
one of these things online often there
is little less fifteen to thirty dollars
then go to a locksmith where they can
cut the keys so it will unlock the door
and so it''ll actually start the car when
you turn it now if where does it sounds
I have a machine that can do that
programming but I''m an independent
mechanic and only bonded locksmiths
or dealership mechanics can get access
to the code so even though I have a
machine I can''t call them myself and if
you ever lose the fob for this keyless
entry system it''s gonna cost you a lot
of money to get another one made which
is why you always want to have at least
two of these things if you don''t and you
bought a car use get another one made at
a locksmith put it in a drawer where you
know it''s safe so you know you''ll always
have a good one you go to a locksmith
and save a ton of money because of
course the locksmiths are gonna charge
you a lot less than a dealer for making
one of these keyless fobs or the key
with a chip in it and if you lose the
keyless fob system be sure to find a
good locksmith because I had a customer
with a 2012 Prius they lost the key and
the dealer charged them 567 dollars to
make a new key and reprogram but when I
had another customer lose their key in a
Prius I sent him to my locksmith who
travels he came to his house so he
didn''t have to tow the car there and his
whole bit
I was 283 dollars instead of 567 dollars
quite a difference just make sure you
get a good bond at locksmith who
understands modern technology because
over the years I''ve tried various ones
and some on there were complete buffoons
that had no idea what they were doing
and then that case when they came to my
shop and said oh they could do it for
150 bucks and they tried for an hour and
they said oh we can''t get it to work I
said well I''m not paying you one cent
you said you could do it you couldn''t so
you gotta find a good locksmith to have
this done so really if you have a
keyless system or a key system that has
a chip inside it take my advice
go to a good locksmiths if you don''t
have two of each and buy another one and
store it somewhere where you remember
where it is so you never have to worry

all right i put a new control unit in
here or master switch and now when you
do that not only does it have to be
programmed but the key fob has to be
programmed as you can see
i''m pressing the buttons it''s not doing
anything
so we need to program this key to the
vehicle again
and uh
it''s pretty simple i''ll show you how now
while i''m thinking of it
if this
if your key fob is not programmed to the
car
if i lock the door and open it or unlock
it and open it from inside
and i i''m not using the lock it''s gonna
think that i broke into the car and it''s
probably gonna set off uh it''s gonna set
off the alarm
you know with the horn
and uh you''re not gonna be able to shut
it off until you program the key and
then hit the unlock button just so you
know and you can program it even with
the security code going off you can
program a key i''ve done it before
so anyway all we''re gonna do right now
it''s in the zero position or off we''re
gonna put the key in and we''re gonna
turn it to the number two position or
the on position
and we''re gonna do that and then i''m
just gonna be pressing you can use
either the unlock or the lock i''m gonna
use the lock button and we''re gonna
press that button in a sequence four
times
so we just have to put the key in we''re
gonna turn it on wait one second
and then hit unlock
now we wait one second
and turn it off
that''s one time
and we turn it back on wait one second
now we hit lock again that''s two
then we turn it off wait a second
turn it back on
hit the lock button again
wait a second
and we turn it off
then we turn it back on
then we hit the lock button again
now we can hear them locked that''s
number four
we hit it again one more time now it
programmed in now if we had additional
keys we could just hit the button and
program them in but we don''t have any
more right now
now we can just turn it off and now
well if i
locked it
see now the keys lock
or it locks and unlocks
i don''t know if you can hear that but
now they''re working
that''s all it takes pretty easy but uh
if you don''t do that step then your key
fob is not going to work so in any event

to our website down below in the

that means you can program it yourself
you''re going to see a little programming
tab right there click on that tab
that''ll have the directions for your
specific year make and model if you
don''t see that tab that means you cannot
do the programming on your own you''re

locksmith to take care of it for you now
with those directions right there just
print them out stick them in your glove
box you''ll have them forever there is
one got you here that I should address
and that is car key remote combos if
your key looks something like that in
the image here a lot of times when they
combined those keys and remotes together
in one unit they actually kept the
electronics separate so you may see
programming directions for the remote
that don''t apply to the key so if you go
through those instructions to program
the key to your car and the remote works
it locks it unlocks the doors but the
car won''t start with the key or the car
starts and dies after just a few seconds
that means that that key needs to be
programmed separately by somebody that
can do that take it into a locksmith
shop or have a locksmith come out to you

tried to use the physical key in the
door like
such and
realized it doesn''t do anything and I
read on the Civic X
forms that sometimes these vehicles
leave the factory with uh the door or
rather the loock linkage disconnected so
I''m going to show you how to reconnect
this linkage uh the forms made it seem
like you had to take the door panel off
uh I don''t believe you do so I''m going
to walk you guys through it all you''re
going to need for this is some kind of
plastic pry tool maybe even your
fingernails uh if your nails are long
enough we just have to get a plastic
cover off and then I also have a ratchet
here with an extension uh and a 10 mm
socket this a/ quar inch ratchet but use
whatever you have here you don''t need
this long of an extension but uh it''ll
do let''s go
first thing you''re going to do is locate
your door pop it open get to this little
access uh panel here going to take our
tool and try to get under this just
enough to kind of pop it up and I think
I got most of it there come
on let''s try this there we go and this
is going to reveal a 10 mm bolt that
holds the whole door handle assembly on
uh so we''re going to remove this
next okay 10 mm on here make sure not to
drop this bolt I''m going to put down the
camera so I can uh make sure to do
that okay my little bolt is out and now
we should be able to remove this the
handle''s going to stay in place a little
bit what we''re going to try to do is
just get up behind uh the lock cylinder
and there is a tab that holds these two
together um so we kind of have to do it
like this
this one handed there we go so we got
the lock out and you can see this is the
long shaft with this kind of almost
Phillips looking cross uh style thing
that engages into the door panel um and
allows you to unlock the door um this is
going to stay here just got to align
this gasket uh right when we put it back
together so I''m trying to get you guys a
shot of the part of the door panel that
it engages with um and you can see it
right there when I looked at mine
through the side of the door through
that little access Hole uh I could tell
it was not even in line with that hole
and it was just flopping around so what
we''re going to do now is try our best to
realign that back into the hole uh
probably probably will take a few times
to get that right um and I''ll report
back after I got it back
in another quick note is if the door uh
handle starts to come off just slide it
back in this direction it has to lock in
uh on this side and then it''ll see there
we go I have to slide this a little more
and it''ll uh behave like normal uh so
what we''re going to do is put this fella
back in there note the tab right here
that has to go behind uh the door
handle okay I''ve got it back on there
door handle is slid back to the left
this is back on um and I actually got
this one on the first try you kind of
see the shaft through there but I''m not
going to be able to get a good image uh
of anything but um I got it in first try
if I put the key in
now you''ll hear the door locks click
we''re good to go what we''ll do is we''ll
uh tighten that 10 mm back down and make
sure my gasket is all aligned you can
see this one''s a little screwed up right
now so I''ll see if I can get it back in
a good
State all right just put that bolt back
in door handle looking good going to put
this cap back in
there good to go now just as expected I
suggest everybody try this you know with
their emergency key make sure it can
unlock and lock your doors um because if
it can''t and your key fob battery dies
uh you won''t be able to get into the car
and you''d rather find this out and fix
it now then have to deal with that uh
you know when you''re stranded somewhere
and your key fob is dead um so thanks
for watching guys hope this helped
thanks quick bonus tip for you guys if
you hit the unlock button and then hold
the unlock button it''ll roll down all
the windows as well as the sunroof um
and with the key fob I don''t believe
there''s a way to undo this and roll back
up the windows so now that your lock
works again uh what you can do you put
it in here bring it to the right
once hold it in this position and the
windows will start to roll back up and
you just got to hold it there as a
safety feature until they''re all back
and rolled
up pretty neat feature especially in the

show you how you can save money if you
need to get another key for your car now
in the olden days between 1994 there are
just simple keys then we''re caught you
could go to hardware store and get one
made for a couple of bucks
but that''s not the case anymore this
newer Toyota has a key that you can open
the doors and things with and it''s got
an immobilizer chip inside so it will
only start if it has the chip and some
modern keys like this one for a 2015
Chrysler you don''t have a key it''s a
remote that you just walk in the car
with and you push your button to start
the car these things can cost a lot of
money if they break or you lose them so
as you as you want to show you how to
save money if you have one that has an
immobilizer chip and has box that open
and close it you can go ahead and buy
one of these things online often there
is little less fifteen to thirty dollars
then go to a locksmith where they can
cut the keys so it will unlock the door
and so it''ll actually start the car when
you turn it now if where does it sounds
I have a machine that can do that
programming but I''m an independent
mechanic and only bonded locksmiths
or dealership mechanics can get access
to the code so even though I have a
machine I can''t call them myself and if
you ever lose the fob for this keyless
entry system it''s gonna cost you a lot
of money to get another one made which
is why you always want to have at least
two of these things if you don''t and you
bought a car use get another one made at
a locksmith put it in a drawer where you
know it''s safe so you know you''ll always
have a good one you go to a locksmith
and save a ton of money because of
course the locksmiths are gonna charge
you a lot less than a dealer for making
one of these keyless fobs or the key
with a chip in it and if you lose the
keyless fob system be sure to find a
good locksmith because I had a customer
with a 2012 Prius they lost the key and
the dealer charged them 567 dollars to
make a new key and reprogram but when I
had another customer lose their key in a
Prius I sent him to my locksmith who
travels he came to his house so he
didn''t have to tow the car there and his
whole bit
I was 283 dollars instead of 567 dollars
quite a difference just make sure you
get a good bond at locksmith who
understands modern technology because
over the years I''ve tried various ones
and some on there were complete buffoons
that had no idea what they were doing
and then that case when they came to my
shop and said oh they could do it for
150 bucks and they tried for an hour and
they said oh we can''t get it to work I
said well I''m not paying you one cent
you said you could do it you couldn''t so
you gotta find a good locksmith to have
this done so really if you have a
keyless system or a key system that has
a chip inside it take my advice
go to a good locksmiths if you don''t
have two of each and buy another one and
store it somewhere where you remember
where it is so you never have to worry

all right i put a new control unit in
here or master switch and now when you
do that not only does it have to be
programmed but the key fob has to be
programmed as you can see
i''m pressing the buttons it''s not doing
anything
so we need to program this key to the
vehicle again
and uh
it''s pretty simple i''ll show you how now
while i''m thinking of it
if this
if your key fob is not programmed to the
car
if i lock the door and open it or unlock
it and open it from inside
and i i''m not using the lock it''s gonna
think that i broke into the car and it''s
probably gonna set off uh it''s gonna set
off the alarm
you know with the horn
and uh you''re not gonna be able to shut
it off until you program the key and
then hit the unlock button just so you
know and you can program it even with
the security code going off you can
program a key i''ve done it before
so anyway all we''re gonna do right now
it''s in the zero position or off we''re
gonna put the key in and we''re gonna
turn it to the number two position or
the on position
and we''re gonna do that and then i''m
just gonna be pressing you can use
either the unlock or the lock i''m gonna
use the lock button and we''re gonna
press that button in a sequence four
times
so we just have to put the key in we''re
gonna turn it on wait one second
and then hit unlock
now we wait one second
and turn it off
that''s one time
and we turn it back on wait one second
now we hit lock again that''s two
then we turn it off wait a second
turn it back on
hit the lock button again
wait a second
and we turn it off
then we turn it back on
then we hit the lock button again
now we can hear them locked that''s
number four
we hit it again one more time now it
programmed in now if we had additional
keys we could just hit the button and
program them in but we don''t have any
more right now
now we can just turn it off and now
well if i
locked it
see now the keys lock
or it locks and unlocks
i don''t know if you can hear that but
now they''re working
that''s all it takes pretty easy but uh
if you don''t do that step then your key
fob is not going to work so in any event

know which one i have working because
i''ve got this tile key finder on it you
might want to pick one of these up on
our website it pairs to your smartphone
and then you can always find your keys
in case you lose them okay to begin
we''re going to take our working key

then we''re going to take the
easy installer and plug it into the obd2
port
come down by your gas and brake pedal
look up
you''re looking for the obd2 plug like
this
just come and plug it in
you''ll hear the programmer beep so you
know it''s plugged in now i need to take
and press the button
on the end of our programmer
we heard the programmer beep
when it beeps twice you turn the
ignition off and we remove the working
key
it beeped once now we''re going to insert
our new key
and turn it to the on position don''t
start the engine
it beeped twice
that lets us know we can turn the
ignition off do not remove the key
it beeps
turn the ignition on

it to beep twice
you might notice a blinking green light
okay there it beeped twice
turn the ignition off it''ll beep again
turn the ignition on still leaving the
same new key in the ignition
and you hear the tune that let us know
it''s successful
so we''re going to turn the engine off
unplug the programmer and check that it
works
okay here we go
there we go wasn''t that easy starts the
engine
let''s check the remote buttons make sure
they work
lock
unlock
trunk and there''s the panic
okay
it''s that easy now i also want to
mention uh the instructions tell you all
about this but if early in the
programming process
the programmer beeps seven times
that means your vehicle already has the
maximum number of keys programmed to it
six keys on this on these honda vehicles
never fear the instructions
teach you how to erase
all except one working key and then you
can follow the same procedure to program
your new keys plus any additional keys
that you may have had before so there
you''ve seen just how easy it is to use
this simple key programmer to make
yourself new keys for honda vehicles go
visit tomsky.com where you can pick up
this simple key kit for your honda and
make keys and save a ton of money over
the cost that the car dealership charges
and if you''re looking for other vehicles
we probably have a kit for that as well

Hey, what''s up? How''s everybody doing?
Welcome to my channel, Mike''s
Automotive. So, today we''re working with
the Honda Civic, you guys. And this is
like 2016 and up for push to start. Now,
the customer had a auto universal remote
pro into the vehicle.
And the thing is that it was kind of
working. It turns on the car when it
wants to. It doesn''t turn on. Sometimes
it does. So, she''s like, "Hey, I''m just
going to get an OEM smart key and just
go ahead and program it." So, I said,
"All right." So, we''re going to be using
our auto. Go ahead and make sure you
have your uh emergency lights on if you
can''t turn it on. If you can turn it on,
turn it on. Okay. Now, um we''re going to
go to automatic uh VIN scan. So, it''s
going to automatically search for the
vehicle using the VIN. Um like I said,
if you can turn it on, turn it on. We''re
going to select smart key.
We''re going to do a push to start. Okay?
Because it''s push to start.
Um, as you guys can see, there''s
information right there for Civic.
Um, we''re going to We always go through
MMO status scan just because it it does
the the scan of the MMO system and it
lets us know something''s wrong with it
um or anything. So, it says is ignition
turned on by pressing the start button.
If you can turn it on, yes. If you can
press no.
So, um, we''re going to go ahead and scan
it. You guys can see it has the smart
system on here and then the immo system.
So, the smart system would be like
anything that''s keyless, any modules
that are that can pick it up, you know,
the immo system, of course, is the
immobilizer system that immobilizes a
vehicle if it''s not the correct key. So,
um, we''re going to go through all keys
lost. Actually, if you have a key, you
can go through add a key, but I''m going
to go through all keys lost because at
the end of the day, their key didn''t
want to turn on the car and off when it
needed to. And this requires you to turn
on and off the car. So, it says to place
the key to be learned in the vehicle and
take all the other keys out.
Is the ignition turned on by pressing
on? Um, no. We can''t turn it on. So,
we''re going to press no. It says press
and hold the start button. So, we''re
going to press and hold the start button
until the until the ignition uh turns on
and the cluster turns on and all the
lights, everything kind of like
accessory mode.
Um, is ignition switched on? Please
release the ignition. We''re going to
press okay.
Okay, here''s the next step. whether it''s
a newer model generally refers to after
2020. We''re going to press no because
it''s not over 2020. It''s like 16 through
18.
Now it''s establish establishing vehicle
communication.
Okay. Checking condition of the vehicle.
Please wait.
Keep program success. Would you like to
program the next one?
Press yes if you have another one. Press
no if you don''t have another one. So
it''s telling us to press the start
button.
Okay, to turn it off.
Now it says to turn it on. So basically
for all Honda, this is how it is. Turn
it off. Turn it on.
So you might have to um
Okay. Are both the keys
keyless? Is indicator immobilizer light
off? Yes, it''s off. We''re going to press
yes. Now again, it''s going to tell us to
shut it off. So, we''re going to press
it.
Now, it says to turn it on. Okay. Now,
now you''re going to have to press it
twice to turn it on every time you press
it. So, press it twice to turn it off
and once, excuse me, press it twice to
turn it on and once to turn it off. As
you guys can see, the registration is
complete. Okay, turn it off. Press it
once to turn it off. Now, don''t put your
foot on the brake, okay? Like, do not
start the actual vehicle. It just wants
you to put it in accessory mode. As you
guys can see, excuse me, it''s
programmed. The remote works. Everything
works perfectly. Um, please don''t forget

is programming a smart key to a 2016 and
up Honda Civic using our Autel IM 608

we''ll also send you any new keys or

to plug it in
come down by your gas and brake pedal
look around until you see the white obd2
plug sometimes it can be a different
color but usually it''s white take the
cable plug it in
now the first thing you need to do is
make sure you have a master key
in order to do that look around find the
blinking red light in this 2018 camry
it''s right here
it can be anywhere on the dashboard
sometimes it can be up above it can even
be over
here and on a few cars all the way over
to the far left side of the steering
wheel you''ll find it blinking steadily
when there''s no key in the ignition
now you take your key
by the way you might want to pick up one
of these tile devices to protect your
investment and keys it links to your
smartphone so you always know where your
keys are at they don''t get lost so
confirm you have a master key
as we slide this in the ignition
watch the blinking red light it''s going
to turn off immediately
that means we have a master key
if when you slide in your key this red
light turns on solid red for two seconds
you have a valet key and you won''t be
able to make a new a new key
unless you have a master key
so
once we''ve confirmed that
we''re going to take tom''s car key
programmer it''s got key and remote
settings
we''ll turn it to the key setting
it''s important for you to know there''s
two things you have to do to program a
key one is program the chip
to release the immobilizer which will
let the engine start otherwise it
immobilizes the vehicle
the second thing you have to do is the
remote portion
so that the remote buttons will work
and
unlock the car lock the car that kind of
thing we''re going to do the key first
we''re going to take our working master
key put it into the ignition
take your working master key
insert it into the ignition turn it two
clicks to the on position
the dashboard will light up but the
engine is not running
take tom''s car key programmer make sure
it''s on the key setting and we''re going
we''ll hear it start beeping
now you want to watch for the solid red
light to turn on
it''s beeping
okay solid red light means it''s ready to
program you''re going to take your new
key
this is uncut notice it''s uncut
take out the working key put this in in
the ignition don''t push too hard but
just as hard just until it stays in
there
you''ll see this start blinking now we''ve
got to wait 60 seconds
watch the blinking pattern it should be
a steady on off
if there''s a different pattern like too
quick a pause and then three quick
it means there''s a something else you''ll
want to email help at tom''s key you''ll
know the key is programmed when this red
light stops blinking
okay it''s getting close
there it stopped blinking
this key is now programmed to this
vehicle so once you get it cut it''ll
start the engine you can check that it''s
programmed and disconnect the programmer
by sliding it into the ignition
notice the red light went off
pull it out the red light''s blinking
again
again be careful because this isn''t cut
you don''t want to push it too hard
just enough that it''ll slip in and stay
you kind of feel it latch into place
now that we''ve got our new key
chip programmed we need to program the
remote buttons so they don''t work right
now
here''s the working one there''s the one

of those up

program it''s really easy to do let''s
take a closer look now the first thing
with the package will come this little
extension cable you find a little plug
that looks like this
occasionally it might have a cover over
the end
take the extension cable
that''ll make it easier to plug in tom''s
car key programmer with the extension
cable plugged in we''re ready to do this
you got to look around and find where
your blinking red security light is
in this camera it''s here on the dash
sometimes up near speedometer sometimes
it''s elsewhere with your new remote and
new key that i''ll send you through tom''s
key company
it''s not going to work at first so your
security light
you put it in security light keeps
blinking
that means there''s not a valid key

see the light turns off a valid working
key
lights blinking
this key doesn''t work let''s look at the
remote
here''s the working remote
unlocks the car
locks the car
makes the alarm
everything''s good
if i take my
one that doesn''t work
nothing works
i''m going to take your working key on
these camrys it''s really important to
take a look at the blade of the key
right here on factory ridge factory
original keys you''ll see a letter in
this case it''s a g
sometimes it can be an h sometimes it
can be a little dot
some years it changes from one symbol to
another
so you got to be sure you''re using the
right symbol that''s the chip in your
vehicle you''re going to take your
working key

label one side says key one side says

slip it over here to
the key side
get our extension cable we''re going to
plug it in
this will start beeping
and we''re going to watch the security
light to turn solid red
there it started beeping
watch the light
okay that means it''s ready to program
the new key take out the working key
put in the new one see this is uncut
now it starts blinking
will now blink for 60 seconds
it''s important to watch the blinking
speed it should be about one blink
per second and then it turns off
if it blinks faster than one per second
that means your vehicle has reached the
maximum number of keys that can be
programmed and you need more
sophisticated equipment to erase any
keys that have been lost
all right
there we go after 60 seconds it stops
blinking this key is now programmed
you can take it to a locksmith
they''ll charge you a few dollars to cut
it to match your existing key it''s that
easy
the blinking light means there''s not a
valid key
in the ignition if we put this existing
one in the blinking light turns off
put this one in the bling lights turns
off
so there you have it that''s programmed
all right let''s take a look at doing the
remote i do want to point out that
process will work for a regular key like
this without a remote i''ll sell these on
tomsky.com
programming the remotes
equally easy we''re going to take our
existing working key
put it on turn it two clicks to the on
position
have the programmer you slide it over to
where it will be labeled with remote
setting
we''re gonna plug it in it''s gonna start
beeping
i''ve got my new remote ready to go
okay that beeping means open the door
it''ll change tones you''re gonna push
lock and unlock
and then lock
just like that
and you heard it the car beep
signaling that it''s done
and take out our existing
and unplug this
and now to show you it locks
unlocks
turn on the alarm
the trunk button
it all works it''s that easy so there you
have it you saw just how easy that was
to program with tom''s car key programmer

and here''s with my new key that I just
programmed see it''s not setting it off

well in today''s video we''re going to be
talking about everything you need to
know about Toyota keys from the smart
key to the mechanical key to diagnosis
to how they work to everything you need
to know there are mainly two types of
keys for Toyotas there is the smart key
and then there is the mechanical key or
also called um internally as a joke the
dumb key before we get started if you''re
new to the channel welcome consider
subscribing to the channel check out
some of my other videos if you are AET
return subscriber well thank you so much
for watching another one of my videos
and without further Ado let''s get right
into
it starting with the mechanical key or
the key that you turn to start there are
mainly two kinds of those there is the
one that has is called a chip key or a
non-chip key the one with a chip is an
immobilizer the one with without a chip
without an immobilizer so basically if
you have a non-chip key you can go to
your local hardware store cut a metal
key and start the car off you go the
chip key I want you to see the chip and
understand how you can recognize what''s
what well the first indication on the
car is if you have a security light
that''s the first indication if you don''t
have it you don''t have a chip key if you
have a security light you do the other
thing is on the key itself on the tip of
the blade there''s usually a DOT a letter
some kind of identification for the chip
the ones that do not have a chip will
not have any markings now it could have
a a key like has a remote like this or
it could be just a plain key it doesn''t
matter that you''re still going to have a
chip and speaking of the chip this is
how the chip looks like here''s where
it''s located on inside the key inside
the case of the key you drop that out of
it it''s done it won''t start the car
anymore and then within those all of
these types there are two important
types that you need to know about there
is a master key and there is there''s a
valet key a few ways to distinguish
which is which but the main thing I want
you to know is the blade shape this is a
master key watch the blade shape at the
end especially at the tip of the
key and here''s a valet key these both
will start the same car but they are
different and the valet key will start
the car but not open the glove box we
not open the trunk you know it''s just
used for valet but the important thing
for our purposes here the master key is
a key you can program off of the valet
key you cannot more on that when we talk
toward the end of the video on how you
program these and what happens if you
lose all the keys having said that about
the mechanical Keys the heavy emphasis
of this video is going to be on the
smart key which I see no information on
the internet that is clear and precise
on on so let''s dig right into
it so the smart keys or the keyless
start or whatever you want to call it
smart key is official word let''s talk
about the consumer side what they do in
a very brief fashion you come to the
door you put the key in your pocket you
touch the door the door opens you open
the door get in put your foot on the
brake press the start button voila car
starts when you''re done you press the
button again car shuts off you get out
of the car you touch the little nibbles
on the door or you push a button if you
have an older one and the car locks
itself and life is good but that''s not
why you''re watching this video let''s
talk about actually what happens behind
the scenes how are these Keys
communicating what are their Generations
what''s what starting
with so there are small little receivers
all across the car in strategic
locations here''s how that looks like
they''re called oscillators and all they
do is they communicate with the key as
you approach they''re always sending this
signal that the key picks up and once
the key picks it up they start
communicating the main thing they will
communicate is two things first one is
it''s called the key ID this is a
permanent code that is stored in every
key and that permanent code is
registered in the car so so that''s going
to be the first thing that gets sent and
the second thing that''s going to get
sent is called a vehicle ID now that
vehicle ID is unique to every car every
car will have an ID and that ID gets
printed on the key so it''s going to send
it okay maybe we have the same key ID
for whatever reason but what about the
vehicle ID this key is not registered to
this car so it needs those two numbers
to match perfectly now there are
different styles and different
configurations of computers but here''s
what happens when when the oscillator
gets these two codes the oscillator is
just a receiver he''s the mailman he
doesn''t make decisions he just get takes
things from A to B the oscillator is
going to send these two codes to a main
muscle of the operation almost it''s
called the certification ECU that''s
lingo for probably some translation from
Japanese but that''s what it''s called
it''s basically a computer that computer
is going to take these codes and it''s
going to communicate with a guy called
the ID box the ID box is a very secure
place where all the codes are stored and
usually in cars equipped with it some
models will have it combined with
another computer but the models that
have it it''ll be buried right behind the
HVAC unit between basically all the way
behind the dash you have to tear the
whole car apart just to replace it or
get to it for security of course now
once it communicates the codes to that
computer it''s going to ask it hey buddy
do you like these numbers do you see
them in your list you look in their list
yep I got that key registered is it
saying the right vehicle ID yes cool I
like that I like this key we have entry
the ID Box gives authorization to open
the door that goes back to the
certification ECU certification ECU yep
picks up the phone calls the body
computer and the body computer that
controls the locks and the doors tells
them we got to go ahead to open the
doors and Flash the flashers
voila door is open now when you go to
start the car things are different
remember I told you there are placed in
strategic locations these oscillators
there''s one by the door there''s one
inside in the back all across so the
computer would have an ability to know
not only if this is a right key but
where is it located in the car cuz you
do not want to start the car when the
key is outside near the car you only
want to start the car when the key is
inside by the driver''s area and that''s
how it''s able to tell from these
different locations where is it picking
up the key closest and strongest signal
is what''s priority that means that''s
where the key is now once the you''re
inside you put your foot on the brake
pedal and you hit that start button
here''s what actually happens behind the
the scenes the certification computer
through the oscillator is going to get
the two codes we like that codes go to
the ID box they do the same dance but
this time when the certification issue
says we''re all good to go it''s going to
call two of its best buddies is going to
call the engine computer pick up the
phone call the engine computer tell them
we have a request to start that is
approved the immobilizer the engine
immobilizer has been unset or it has
been unlocked because we have an
authenticated ID code and vehicle code
this key is good we''re good to start and
the other thing is going to do and if
you notice in these smart key cars the
steering wheel locks usually in a
mechanical key you put the key turn it
and the key and the steering wheel
unlocks but in a smart key you don''t
have that so it actually has a computer
and a little motor that locks the
steering well that''s the other computer
that''s going to get a call from the
certification ECU hey man we got a key
unlock the steering wheel life is good
car is going to start everything is good
but it doesn''t end there because this is
where Toyota takes security a little bit
to the next level because if you were
right next to your car and you started
it and then the key left or they were
hacking into the car trying to steal it
I mean this is we''re talking about very
complicated stuff if you have a thief
that is able to bypass all this uh they
could be not interested in your car and
trying to do bigger stuff cuz that''s a
lot of highlevel theft here I wish they
were dedicated to better things in life
but nonetheless one last security later
after the car starts after the engine
starts and everything is running within
10 seconds after the car is
starting the computer will send a unique
code that is heavily encrypted to the
certification ECU and to everybody
telling them we are still
good that code is essential because if
this car was hacked stolen whatever the
case may be you you do not initiate that
code from the key you initiate that from
the computer meaning 10 seconds have
passed and we''re still good the smart
key still good the code is still good
everything is exactly the same and
everybody has all the computers have
gotten together again and said we''re all
good but if it''s not it''s going to shut
off the engine again and disable
everything some of these cars and they
have a mobilizer problems and especially
when you go putting aftermarket remote
starts that one wire that send that code
it''s called the gcode if you are
interested in what it''s called that one
wire notorious to break because it''s a
tiny communication wire and now the car
starts shuts off within 10 seconds and
nobody knows what''s going on it has all
kinds of codes because that one wire is
broken and it cannot send that
confirmation code if you
would let''s talk about the generations
of smart Keys briefly so you understand
why they are slightly different and they
how they evolve so the first one is the
initial smart key in any Toyota is the
2004 Prius first generation and the
worst one sorry if you own a 2004 or
second generation Prius actually it''s
the whole second generation 04 to9 but
it was ancient and it was horribly
ancient not in a good way not like the
4Runner for example that''s a good
ancient it was basically a mechanical
key that had the smart functions kind of
added on top of it so it operated like a
mechanical key but it had this you could
open the door and push the start button
and there was this over complicated
process to program them to do all this
mess and that''s why it was gone it was
it was never used in another car other
than the first generation Prius it was
not made by denzo it was made by
somebody else some long name and I''ll
put on the screen here that''s the
company that made it God bless them they
did a good job but it was a hor system
for lack of better word we''re more
interested in the second third fourth
and potentially fifth generation which
is what you see in most of these the
second generation which was great and it
started with the 05 Avalon now the 05
Avalon has a very weird looking key
different than anybody else but it is
actually the same generation that
generation went from 05 all the way to
almost 09 10 depends when the model
changes that generation worked exactly
as we talked that whole same the only
difference between these Generations the
frequencies and some of the computer
orientation was different like some of
them combined the computers some of them
that''s only real difference third
generation and fourth generation and I
say that because they''re exactly the
same just the frequency changed is the
third generation started from around
2009 2010 and the fourth generation
which is possibly the best so far
started from around 2012 actually it''s
debuted on the 2012 Toyota Camry and it
went all the way into a lot of models up
until the ghost fifth generation it''s
never really called the fifth generation
because nothing really changed very
minor things Chang but it is actually
what started in the 18
Camry like this 2021 ra for behind me
here''s the key and it actually says the
name of the model on it and it
physically looks different than the old
ones however that''s the generations of
these keys if you''re interested to know
where you fall in this if you don''t have
a second generation Prius they all
pretty much work exactly the same and
still today so there is
that so let''s talk about a few things
that you might not know about this every
time you shut off your car you open the
door and you leave it open you hear the
annoying
ding that''s just the way it is it
reminds you that you need to take your
key out out but if actually you close
the door and open it it locks the
steering wheel and now it don''t ding
anymore as they all do that it''s very
annoying and if you don''t want to close
the door and open it you can just reach
in and press that courtesy switch which
is basically imitates the door closing
and opening and you''ll hear a steering
lock engage and life is good the other
thing is you can actually cancel the
smart key functions in the first
generation there was a physical button
in the Prius that cancels the smart
functions and all of them there''s a
procedure to cancel it if you cancel the
smart key function you will need to
press the physical button on the REM
mode now that signal goes completely to
a different signal goes to the regular
receiver that has also the tire pressure
monitor in it and that''s a completely
different cycle of how you''re going to
unlock the doors and when you want to
start the car and this applies the same
if the battery inside of this guy is
dead you''re going to hold that key
against it you''re going to hold the
Toyota emblem on the key against the
start button and then press it that
actually bypasses cuz this key is able
to transmit things very short range
without a battery that''s how they''re
designed and there''s a receiver in there
it''s this over complication to explain
it but we''ll keep it simple put this in
front of the emblem of the start button
and life is good another thing is the
battery inside these Keys now most folks
will go years and this battery is still
good some of them every 6 month the
thing is dead and they have to replace
it well here''s a tip for you that it was
actually discovered down the road when
the smart key came out so the frequency
that this key transmits on it''s
basically the oscillator will send a
small frequency that wakes up the key
and starts the key starts transmitting
the
code if you have another device
computers whatever the case may be that
actually happen to transmit the same
signal this key will start emitting its
signal infinitely
until it''s a certain amount of time has
passed then it stops then it gets that
signal again and starts and starts so
that actually kills the battery and and
the way to know if this key is
transmitting is if you look at it it has
a red dot as soon as it starts
transmitting doesn''t matter if you could
take this key walk to a similar car
that''s not yours it will not unlock it
but I''ll actually start flashing that
little red light indicating there''s
communication doesn''t mean there is
successful communication but there is
communication and that starts draining
the battery now the battery have a fail
safe in it if to protect the battery if
the battery drops below a certain level
it won''t flash the light anymore and
eventually it completely dies and shuts
down now you have to hold it against the
start
button now let''s get into the uh meats
and potato of this video the programming
part the part that there''s not a lot of
information and there there was a lot of
misinformation about so let''s start from
the beginning this will apply to both
key types to the mechanical one and the
smart key is a similar process for both
except the first generation key smart
key which happens to be in the 2004 2009
Prius that is completely different let''s
start when you have to program a key
this can be done on a dealership but it
also can be done by a good locksmith
they can do that there''s no problem with
that all it does is it''s going to
require you to have one registered
master key now all smart keys are
Masters there''s no such thing but in the
case of the mechanical Keys you need a
master key it cannot be a valet key
because the valet key even with that
security in mind it does not unlock or
do what we need to do so basically
having that key that''s already
registered you''re going to use that code
to unlock the computers so you get in
them and add a new code for the new key
that''s all it is so if you lose one key
most of these cars come with two keys
from the factory some of them three in
the case of the
Mechanicals you need a registered key to
program a new key there''s no way around
it that''s how it is and that''s usually
very cheap at a dealership should not
cost a small fortune if you have a
mechanical key that has a remote the
remote is a separate programming if it
has a separate remote that''s also a
separate programming but the smart key
it is a one thing program except the
over o09 Prius that''s that''s
yeah it''s onetime shot you program it
the remote already starts working on the
smart key and everything is done and
then there is another function on the
leadership level don''t know if this
locksmith can do that let''s say you have
two keys your key was
stolen you know it happens things happen
you already you still have one key you
come to program another key but now
you''re worried what if that person that
stole my key is going to come and start
my car and steal my car now so there''s a
function to erase Keys you basically
bring us at the dealership all the keys
and we will go in unlock the immobilizer
using your code on the key and then
erase any keys that are not here you''re
basically going to scan the keys again
through the start button and tell the
computer these are the only codes I want
to work everything else erase it so you
effectively erase the keys and last but
not least on this section it''s very
important that you still have a good a
very good locksmith you can''t have an
amateur do this anything to do with the
immobilizer system is Mega complicated
and once thing''s locked down it''s over
so make sure it''s a good locksmith yes
the dealership could charge more but
these keys are very expensive to begin
with and used keys there is a catch with
used Keys we''ll talk about this so what
happens if you lose all your keys what
happens then here''s the problem if you
don''t have a key that works currently to
unlock the immobilizer and all these
computers so you can change things it''s
locked it''s done you cannot get in so
the only way to get in is through a kind
of a master unlock code called the seed
number that''s what toyoto calls it again
a fancy probably translation from
Japanese that seed number is generated
by the by the computer but in order to
decipher that seed number or de decrypt
it you need to go to the Toyota website
online to to you can register this event
you put your name your manager''s name
the manager needs to approve it and a
record of this goes to the government
which then will keep track in case this
car was stolen so they know who
programmed the key and they can they
there''s a record to track to prevent
thefts because you know what every
technicians have the ability to program
a key and uh not everybody''s a good
person so there is a record now you
cannot just program a key steal a car
and have a nice day they''re going to
come back after you because they know
you programmed the key
last so once that code is decrypted it
gives you a master unlock code you go
back in the car you enter that seed
number and then the process takes 160
minutes to
unlock the computers and once they are
unlocked they''re erased clean and they
are back to their Factory setup where
they are ready to program new keys from
scratch once you are in that state of
everything is fresh and waiting for new
programming similar if you would have
replaced all the
computers
then you can rewrite the vehicle
ID you''re probably wondering what am I
talking about used Keys when you buy an
used key off of eBay or Amazon or
whatever that key will get there is an
ability to get it programmed to the car
but it won''t work because the vehicle ID
is imprinted in this key now of the
previous car you''re trying to run it on
your car it won''t work the only time you
can reprogram the vehicle ID inside of
these Keys is when you do basically a l
all keys operation
now this becomes kind of
counterproductive if you buy a used key
to save a few bucks then have to go to
the dealership pay a small fortune to uh
just make this key work why don''t you
just buy a new key to begin with I don''t
know but here''s what that could work if
you have a very very very good locksmith
not everybody and be very careful with
this for the following if you have a
very good locksmith they could have the
ability or the software but to kind of
decrypt that code that comes out of the
car but just know that that''s actually a
hack and it is not it''s a computer hack
and it is not an official or approved
procedure so you''re basically going
through a back door to get this to
happen and the reason I want you to have
a very very good locksmith because if
this goes south you could permanently
lock these computers and now no matter
what you you take it their dealership
they''ll just tell you yep you need a few
thousand to replace every single
computer involved because they''re all on
lock down now so be careful make sure
the locksmith that is doing this knows
what they are doing and have done it
before because if they don''t they could
break your car and you''ll they''ll
disappear into the wind and you''re left
with a four times bigger Bill than if
you would have told your car a
dealership to begin with so be
careful and for diagnosis I want to
share with you a few things the key the
biggest thing is you need to look at the
flashing light on the key as you see
here that light is flashing the key is
communicating with the car now is it
sending the right stuff is it working
right that''s different story but that''s
your first code of diagnosis the key
stops working the first thing you want
to do is walk up to the door of the car
and then see if that light starts
flashing it''ll flash once twice whatever
the case may be but that''s your first
mode of diagnosis every time you have a
problem with a smart key system you
replace the battery that''s an automatic
the other thing and this is some tips
that I will share with you from
experience I cannot tell you how many
cars get tow in the dealership that
won''t start after a dead battery with a
smart key because here''s something
that''s interesting for you when the
battery dies if it dies in the process
of the smart key starting that whole
communication gets jammed and now we
have like an error and that error stays
because the battery died and it never
got cleared
when you bring a car back from a dead
battery you need to turn the key on and
let it be for a couple minutes otherwise
it won''t start you press the start
button nothing happens it just all the
lights and the dash come up nothing
happens and that brings so many people
Towing the car in all I do is go in the
go in the car turn the key on wait for a
minute or two after a jumper is on the
battery and starts right up so I''ll
share this one with you because it takes
them some time for all these computers
to communicate
and everything you go back to normal and
this system is really trouble-free for
the most part the oscillators they''re
very simple they scattered across the
car typically there''s one in the
interior close to the driver''s seat
that''s the one that picks up when the
key is ready to start and life is good
with this system other than the battery
dying all the time or accidents or
wiring damage stuff that are not DIY
you''re really not going to have that
many problems with these and one last
thing that makes these Keys stop working
interference other than you know what we
talked about that kills the battery
similar interference could actually
cause them not to work so when you''re
smart key all of a sudden you come to
the door and it doesn''t want to open and
it doesn''t want to start you got to
unlock hit unlock on the key and then go
inside and put the key against the
button every time you got to look at
your environment if it h especially if
it happens intermittent are you do you
happen to have that problem in the same
spot every time that could be
interference and I''ve seen so many
people get very frustrated every time I
go out of work it don''t want to start I
have to put the key and do all that well
does there happen to be a giant
Transformer right next to the car that
is jamming the signal of this key I
don''t know so if you have an
intermittent problem try to isolate it
is it happening in the same spot every
single time cuz I bet you that''s going
to be the problem cuz we''ve seen so many
folks that come in the dealership and
say my smart key does not work sometimes
every time I go to X B or Z it don''t
want to start well because you might
have interference in that spot so that''s
one thing I want to bring to your
attention as
well if you lose one please make another
one if you lose your mechanical key you
always have two with a car when you go
buy one used ask for the second one if
they don''t have it request that is
included in the deal you always should
have two keys for these cars if you lose
one go get one don''t procrastinate
because you could easily lose the second
one and now you''re stuck with this whole
mess it happens all the time sometimes
I''ve seen people working at a dealership
I''ve seen people carry all three keys in
one keychain for the same car and I try
them they''re they''re for the same car
it''s like what''s the point of having
three keys if you carry them all we''re
going to lose them in one shot job
security for me I suppose please don''t
do that I I really it pains my heart
every time I see people having to pay a
small fortune to program keys that they
lost it''s it things happen in life but
if you''re proactive about it and don''t
let it happen you won''t be in that
situation one last note I would like to
say before we wrap up this video this
all applies to the newer Toyotas the
receding part there are two cases that
I''d like to bring to your attention one
of them is older cars early 2000s into
the ''90s
the ones that have IM
mobilizer unfortunately in these models
and namely 98 to 2002 Sienna that''s just
that''s one example of them you cannot do
the the receding process when you lose
all keys you have to replace the
computers there''s no way to go in
through the scan tool and unlock them to
a new state just like the other ones you
can you cannot do that that''s not
possible so you lose all keys on these
is going to easily total that car you
have to replace all the computers so be
careful especially if you have older
ones like that the other thing is there
are some of the new models going back to
that we have had some reports of this R
4 behind me with the mechanical key that
you must replace some components because
they are not unlocking and things are
not working so the moral of this story
is don''t lose your keys if things
happened that''s why you have two keys
you lost one key go and get a second one
immediately as soon as possible it''s
very expensive I understand but trust me
when you lose all your keys it''s going
to be even more expensive just thought
i'' let you know that I hope this video

                             VALUES ('mg8e8IMqXPo', 'in this video i''m going to show you how
to program one remote head key
for all a toyota
and scion vehicles that are using this
exact remote head key
for this video i''m sitting inside the
2016 toyota camry
but whether you are sitting in exactly
the same car as i am or any other toyota
vehicle
as long as you are using this exact
remote head key the programming process
is exactly the same
okay a few things that is important for
me to mention before we start is first
of all
once i''m going to program this key
all of the old keys that used to be
working before in the vehicle will be
erase
and this remote head key going to be the
only key that will be programmed and
will stay programmed to the vehicle
after the programming process will be
completed
second of all i''m going to show you now
that this
a key is not yet programmed i''m going to
press the lock
and unlock
okay lock and unlock and you can see
that the remote part of the key is not
programmed and if i''m going to put the
key inside the ignition and i''m going to
try to start the engine
okay you can see and also here that the
key is not starting the engine another
way that you can see that the key is not
programmed is based on this security
light you see that right now the
security light is blinking
if i''m going to put the key the
unprogrammed key inside the ignition the
security light will keep blinking it
will keep blinking because it''s not
recognized the key as a programmed key
if the key was a programmed key
once i''m gonna once i would put it
inside the ignition the security light
would disappear because it would
recognize this key as a programmed key
so this is just another way to to to see
that this key is not yet programmed
okay so in this video i''m going to show
you how to program
the remote head key and i''m going to
show you how to do it step by step
okay so what we need to do we need first
of all before everything
to open the driver''s side door okay
from now until the end of the
programming process the driver''s side
door will have to be open and remain
open the entire process
all of the other doors in the car will
have to be closed and remain closed the
entire of the entire process so again
driver door will have to be open and all
of the other door will have to be closed
and remain closed until you finish the
programming process
all right so next what we need to do
we take the key
put it inside the ignition and we twist
it to the on position
okay next
we take the obd cable adapter
and we need to connect it to the obd
port which is located under the steering
column
okay now we can go to the programming
process and then using the computer hi

[Applause]
[Music]
okay so of course we''re going to turn on
the profit right here
okay and after we turn on the profit
we''re going to look here
and see that the bluetooth light turned
into blue
it did turn into blue it means that now
we have a connection we can start the
all right so make sure that your
immobilization at the top
and what we''re going to look we''re going
to look for us toyota okay there it is
toyota we''re going to press on us toyota
in the disclaimer press agree
okay and
we''re gonna do this
not always you''re gonna have the scream
that i have it so it was just updating
me about something so i just press say
no or okay and right now in this screen
what we''re gonna choose we''re gonna
choose key
in this screen we''re going to choose by
type
in this screen we''re going to do we''re
going to choose immobilizer
and in this screen we''re going to choose
auto identify
the auto identify will try to identify
the
the system the programming system
automatically based on the v number and
as you can see it did find it so we''re
going to press ok
ok and right now
what we''re going to choose we''re going
to choose reset immobilizer when all key
is lost so basically we have no key we
want to program one key and we''re gonna
choose reset immobilizer all key is lost
now the computer let us know to turn the
ignition to the on position as you can
see the ignition is already in the on
position so you''re gonna press ok
now the computer let us know it says
please ensure that the driver door is
open during the process remember i
explained earlier that the driver door
will have to remain open and all of the
other doors in the vehicle will have to
be closed and remain closed so the
computer just let us know that uh to
make sure that we do it okay so we''re
gonna press okay
okay uh as you can see procedure
complete turn ignition off remove the
key insert the key and turn the ignition
on okay so basically what we need to do
we need to turn the ignition to the off
position
and take the key out now we need to put
the ignition to the key to the ignition
again into the ignition again and turn
and what we''re going to do now we''re
now the computer let us know to insert
master key and turn the ignition to the
on position
as you can see the ignition is already
in the on position so we''re going to
press ok
communicating
and the computer let us know that the
procedure is complete i want you also to
pay attention here to the security light
the security light and by the way the
security light doesn''t have to be here
it can be somewhere else on the
dashboard depending the car that you are
doing but this is how it look it''s a car
symbol with a lock inside so you can see
that right now it stays on the moment i
will press ok the security light will
disappear so i''m going to press ok
and as you can see the security light
just disappeared okay so basically right
now the key should be programmed
okay so i will take the key out and the
key part of the remote head key should
be programmed so let''s let''s test it i''m
going to put the key inside the ignition
twist it to the on position
okay and as you can see and also here
the car started okay that''s
because the key is program so now i''m
going to show you that the remote part
of the key is not yet programmed so i''m
going to press the lock
and the unlock
okay you can say that the remote part of
the key is not programmed so basically
this is the remote head key and you have
two parts you have the key with the
transponder chip inside which is already
programmed
but we also have the remote and the
remote part is not yet programmed so now
we''re gonna go to the next step which
will be to program the remote okay so
this is how we do it we put the key
inside the ignition and twist it to the
then we''re gonna go here to the truck
symbol
the track symbol will take us to the
main screen which we can start the whole
process again
so here we''re going to press on us
toyota
and
uh uh here we''re gonna press yes we''re
gonna start new diagnosis if you have
this screen not always you''re gonna have
it but if you do press yes
okay in this screen what we''re gonna
choose we''re gonna choose remote
and here in the screen we''re going to
choose auto identify
again the auto identifier will identify
the vehicle based on the v number and
will let us know which system we need to
use and it''s going to do it
automatically for us
okay as you can see it did find it as
type 2 and we''re going to press ok
ok in this screen what we''re going to
choose we''re going to choose program
remote
switch ignition on open the driver door
so basically the computer just let us
know that the ignition need to be in the
on position and the driver door needs to
be opened similar to what we did before
all of the doors in the vehicle will
have to remain closed
driver door needs to be open the entire
process until it''s going to be done okay
so we''re going to press yes
and what we need to do soon and i got
with me another
one second
okay press the lock and unlock together
for 30 seconds and press the lock
the lock button once press ok to
continue so i just got another key in
order to show you what i need to do
because the key inside the ignition is
going to be very hard to see what i''m
going to do we''re going to have to press
the lock and unlock together
release it
and then press the lock button and after
that we''re gonna hear
something like this so let''s do it right
now
press the lock and unlock together for
leave it and then press the lock one
time
okay we didn''t hear the the the big beep
but we''re gonna press okay let''s see if
it catch it
programming success we''re gonna press
okay
okay normally after you press the lock
and unlock together
release it and then press the lock you
you you will be able to hear from the
car uh two beeps something like
i didn''t hear it maybe it was here but i
didn''t hear it maybe it''s because i took
a little bit a
longer time than usual because i i was
explaining you what what i''m doing but
basically the computer let us know that
the programming is successful right now
we can put the computer on this side
okay and we can take the key outside of
the ignition and basically right now i
have the key with me and let''s test the
remote i''m going to press the lock
lock and unlock and you can see now that
the remote part of the remote head key
is programmed and if i''m going to put
the key inside the ignition

questions for you on how to program a
Ford key and key fob stay tuned hello my
name is Derrick and welcome to hindsight
101 well you learn about things that
will help you in everyday life now I
made a video a while back about how to
program a Ford key and Ford key fob and
there were a lot of questions a lot of
them were the same questions but there
were a lot of questions so I just wanted
to answer all those so everyone can be
informed let''s get started now the main
question everyone always asks is how
many keys do I need in order to program
an extra key well that''s kind of a
tricky one so you''re going to need two
keys no matter what in order to program
a spare key if you don''t have two keys
then unfortunately you''re gonna have to
go to the dealership or a locksmith or
Hart some hardware stores but if you go
to the dealership know that it is going
to be expensive so what do I mean by two
working Keys you need two keys that if
you put it in the ignition it will start
the car that is two working keys if you
have that then you can program a third
key if you don''t you''re out of luck but
there is one caveat if you have a remote
start I do not have one I''ll link a
video below kind of demonstrating that
but basically is your remote start X
just like a key so what you would do is
you would press the remote start button
while you''re in your vehicle the
dashboard will light up but before the
car actually turns on you hit the brake
and that signifies your first key turn
and then you take your normal key you
turn that and then turn it off and then
you take your unprogrammed key put that
in to program it I''ll link my video
below so you can see that one as well
the next question is it doesn''t matter
what type of key you have you can have a
key that has the key fob attached you
could have a key fob and then another
key that has a different type of key fob
it doesn''t they don''t have to match they
just have to work or you could have a
just a plain key that has no key fob or
you could have a key that doesn''t have
the key fob attached to it any four of
those will work so you could take two of
those any four and as long as they start
your vehicle you can program them to
program a second third fourth how many
keys you want
up to you now that leads into my next
question is where do I get my key from a
lot of people get their keys from eBay
hell I got my key from eBay but you have
to be careful you want to make sure you
have a good return policy because the
first key I got didn''t work it would
start the car
but the key fob wouldn''t unlock or lock
the doors the third keep the second key
I got a little more expensive but it
worked just fine but both sites said
they would work with my vehicle so
whatever in the comments in my video a
lot of people said they got theirs from
Amazon and they work pretty well so you
would have to pay more for that 30 bucks
as opposed to 10 or 6 dollars depending
what you get but a lot of times the eBay
they just want to sell a key they could
care less if it''s gonna work or not
they''ll just say it does so you have to
kind of be careful about that but those
are the three main things that people
really want to know about programming
their Ford key so I hope this helps if
you have any more questions just submit
them below thank you like and subscribe

work for this type of key and also the
key that''s just a key and a separate key
fob this will work for all 2004 Ford
vehicles or later full disclosure I did
have some camera troubles and I had to
re-record so this key is already
programmed but I guarantee you this
works you can see I have two Ford keys
and then I also have this key here which
I got from eBay so what we''re going to
do is you need two keys in order for
this to work so if you don''t have two
keys you''re gonna have to go to the

hardware stores do it as well so let''s

you''re going to take one of your keys

turn the car on and then this will put

you know you''re in program mode when you
hear the doors lock so now what you want
to do is hit the lock button on all the
keys that you have I forgot to mention
you want to make sure you have all the
keys that you need with you because it''s
going to reset all your key fobs so you
have to have all your keys with you and
you have to program them all not just
one so that''s why you had to press the
lock on all the keys take the key out
you hear the doors lock that means
you''re out of program mode so and then
one key to key and key three they all
work and then the key that I wanted to

right now
um and i am going to show you how to go
from the old style key to the new style
key
all right so let''s go through
i could not find any videos of someone
that had my particular car
trying to upgrade keys i mean upgrading
keys is not really a common thing
but i''m going to show you how i did it
because these keys
this bottom thing always breaks um
it''s just not a great key um
and this is just a lot more solid
obviously it''s missing a little
extra key thing right here but let me
show you how i did it all right so
it is a process of going from your car
completely off to your car going into
accessory mode
while you have your key in its little
slot
now i think mine''s a 2015 i think on the
later models
it''s in one of these cup holders so
check under here
i think it''s like right here anyway so
for a 2015
with keyless entry and keyless start
i have my two original keys
right here okay and
what you''re gonna do is you''re gonna
take your first key
with the buttons up and place it
in there like so now your car is
completely off i''m just doing this
because i have ac and i''m not actually
doing it
so car is completely off you press
the car so that it turns into accessory
mode on
you count five seconds five seconds
turn it off now take this key out
put it over here put the other one in
there
keys up turn it accessory on
five mississippi accessory off
now this key out and take your new key
without the the actual key this part
just press a button
buttons up in there
and go ahead and press accessory on
now at this point my truck
uh blinked its hazards
and uh it said key programmed
uh i tried this about 10 times
unsuccessfully
and then the 11th time i was able to do
it i held this down
a little bit and i pressed the button
and that''s when it worked
now i tried it with the ford symbol
up and it didn''t work when i tried it
with the buttons up
it worked maybe coincidence but um i''m
telling you my recipe
for this to be a successful um key
programming
so i''m going to go over it one more time
keep
cars completely off you''re going
one key buttons up in the slot
cars off hit this to turn accessory mode
on
five seconds turn it off change the key
again on one two three four five
mississippi
off take it out put those to the side
now you take your new key put it in
hold it down on
and then at that point you should see
some
unusual activity either hazards flashing
it says right there
uh key programmed and then this will
work
so you can see
um and then obviously the car is on so i
can''t show you it starting but
all the buttons work it all works i got
this on ebay
for like 40 bucks i could put a link
below to the guy
that sold them to me i was a little
concerned but i now am going to get a
second one of these
so that i have my primary and my
secondary
are these new type and then these i can
have just in case
anything goes wrong but hope that helps

you''re good now because this my this is
a truck and doesn''t have a trunk the
trunk button does not work but this fob
will work so let''s say you have this fob
and the Keyblade broke and let''s just
say getting one of these is more
expensive than just up this fob
well actually that wouldn''t work either
wouldn''t nevermind okay since ignore
what I was going to say they''re gonna
say you can just get one of these and
program it but if the blade is broken
then yeah so anyway oh well I guess what
you can''t do is if this fob is bad
completely buddy tried to change
batteries try programming it nothing
happens and it ends up being more
expensive to get one of these and these
just by one of these program it and just
keep it on the keyring use this to lock
and unlock the car but have this to put
in ignition and start it so and of
course these keys don''t go to this truck
it''s not before this truck that''s what
this is for
that goes to the truck and just to show
you that thing still works at this shut
so anyway that is how you program a key
fob for a Ford vehicle now this works
was Ford Lincoln Mercury Mazda of this
airs for like the Mazda Tribute which is
a Ford Escape the Mercury Mariner Ford
Explorer
no that''s the Mercury Mariner is the
xscape Mercury I forget what the mercury
version of the Explorer is but then you
got the markers sable for Taurus things
like that so I''ll show you gotta do it
one more time Vincent the key and eight
times one two three four five six seven
eight
in a fob and there you go that''s how you
program a key fob for Ford Lincoln
Mercury I''m not sure how far back older
Ford''s work for different fob like a 93
I don''t think 93 X force at it I think
but like a 94 95 I don''t know if third
it''s the same process if they are or you
can try it if not you''ll have to look up
on the Internet the technique on how to
program it for that so anyway I hope

I just wanted to make a quick video
explaining how you start your vehicle
and you get inside of it whenever your
key fob battery dies if you have a key
fob that''s this style maybe it''s a three
button a four button or a five button
like I have here these batteries you
know they tend to wear out after a few
years I''ve taken the battery out of this
key fob so there''s no battery inside of
it and I''m gonna show you how to start
the vehicle if your battery is dead in
this case the battery is not gonna be in
the fob at all first to get in there''s a
lever in the back of the key right here
you pull the lever over and I''ll let you
slide the bladed key out this will let
you turn turn the lock on the driver''s
door hand okay so that''s how you get
inside the vehicle once you''re inside
what you want to do right now the
vehicle won''t start I''m holding the
brake pressing this button it shows me
warning key ID incorrect that means the
battery''s dead in key this case no
battery like I said so what you want to
do you want to hold the key fob one inch
away from the start button here I''ll
hold I have my foot on the brake like
normal and then you just press the
button there and it detects it vehicle
starts you can drive it it''s still gonna
say warning key ID incorrect cuz until
you get a new battery if you come up
here to walk to hatching Nissan will get
those replaced for you but please like

nissan maxima i''m going to just show you
real quick
if your key fob goes dead
there''s several ways to start the car
the first trick
these batteries go dead in here you have
enough power to start the car
by touching the key to the button
and it will start foot on the brake
and start that''s if your fob is dead
and sometimes it loses programming
so what you have to do if you look on
the dr
on the same thing on the driver''s side
left the steering wheel
there''s a little port in here see that
little port
you slide the key in and it relearns
now you can also leave the key there
just to start it if you wanted to
just leave it there see car starts
put that in there i just press that so
if you get an
indication on your dash that there''s no
key
and it''s not communicating you either
want to touch the key
to the button to start it that only
works for so long
you can change the key fob battery which
i do have a
a video on that and then if you need to
sort of reprogram this
because of that you stick it in this
little port and it will reprogram
it and you''ll be good to go

infinity vehicle or maybe you have a
regular key and need a new one of those
for your nissan or infinity vehicle well
i''m mike i want to show you how you can
use this simple key programming kit
available from tomsky.com to program new
fob or new key for your nissan and
infinity vehicles in only 15 minutes
let''s take a look once you''ve ordered
this simple key programming kit from our
website tomsky.com it''ll arrive in the
mail in just a few days
in the box
it comes the user guide for the simple
key programmer there''s some important
instructions here like making sure your
vehicle battery is good and charged turn
off your headlights your air
conditioning your heater your radio any
lights that are going to be drawing the
battery you don''t want the battery to
drain while you''re doing the programming
process
all right there''s two steps to
programming your fob any fobs that came
in the box are going to require an
activation step
many times if you order additional fobs
that come separately they may not
require the activation step so let me
first show you how to go through the
activation you find your vehicle this
lookup table today we''re doing a nissan
altima 2015
and we have the four button remote with
trunk
so
we need code 42.
the instructions will walk you through
everything you need to do the first step
is to press the top and the bottom
button at the same time
and you''ll see a blue light that turns
on solid if you got a blue light like
that you know you need to go through
activation
now if you wait too long before entering
the code it''ll time out and you have to
start over so be aware that many times
in this programming process steps are
time sensitive
let''s get it ready to activate okay
lights on solid we''ll use the top button
to enter the number four we''ll use the
second button to enter two
one
two
three
four
now that we''ve completed that we push
the bottom button on the fob
for about two seconds till it begins
flashing back the code
okay one two three four pause
one two okay we entered the code four
two so it''s been activated
we''ve entered the code four two
successfully so this is now activated
for 2015 nissan altima
now there''s a few things you should be
aware of with this
simple key
programmer first it has a
tamper evidence seal so once you use
this on your vehicle it will pair to the
vin on your vehicle now you can program
up to four keys or four fobs for nissan
and ultimate vehicles with this
programmer so that can be helpful just
know you won''t be able to use it on a
different vehicle next
in this programming procedure the
instructions tell us to turn it to dial
position number seven
there we got it on 7.
now with the vehicle turned off the
engine not running come down we''ve got
to find the obd2 port it''s down near the
breaking gas pedal in this case we find
it right there we''re going to plug the
programmer in we''ll we''ll hear it beep
as it plugs in
now there''s some instructions that''ll
help walk you through these steps hold
to confirm means to press the button for
about two seconds
so we''ve got our one working key fob uh
notice this is the one with the tile key
finder if you don''t have one of those
you might want to pick it up on our
website it''ll pair to your smartphone to
help you always know where your keys are
at
in case you lose them at the park or
they''re lost in your house
okay let''s go through this
it says
hold to confirm here we go
i''m gonna open the door
and close the door
and i''m going to turn the hazard lights
on
press to continue
it warns us do not press the brake
during the programming process
it''s communicating with the vehicle
press and hold the start button until
the dash lights turn on
so i''m pressing and holding the start
button
dash light is turned on i let go
and we press to continue
it''s communicating with the vehicle turn
the ignition off
all right press start with the remote
the security light will blink
okay i''m going to press
and release
now the security light''s flashing on the
dashboard you see that right there
flashed five times
this key is now paired again we''re going
to
all right turn the ignition off
ignition''s off
all right do we want to pair another key
why yes yes we do we need to pair the
new one now
so press to continue or you press you
click you click once to end but we need
to hold it down to pair another key so
let''s hold it down for a couple seconds
okay pick up the next key we got the
next key
this is the new one we''re programming
that we activated
press start with the remote the security
light will blink here it is we''re going
to watch for the security light to blink
i''m pressing
start but i''m not holding it down
one two three four five sorry it was
blurry there
but you saw the security light blink
we''re going to press to continue
turn the ignition off
the ignition is now off
pair another key hold the pair press end
we''re not doing any more key fobs today
so i''m just going to make a quick click
to end
to exit pairings press press start with
paired remote i''m going to press start
press and release the dashboard lights
all turned on
start to turn the ignition off turn the
vehicle off
key registration complete
okay unplug the
installer
okay i''ve moved the key fobs away from
my vehicle i''m gonna try and start it
now
[Music]
and it tells me it can''t detect a key
okay i''ve got my original one let''s make
sure it works
okay vehicle turned on just fine
now i''ve got the new one let''s try
starting the vehicle with it
and voila
there we have it
both key fobs lock and unlock the doors
and start the vehicle
after you''ve completed programming don''t
forget to cut the emergency keyblade to
avoid the hassle of finding a car
dealership or locksmith to cut the key
you can order our optional key by photos
key cutting service
if you complete programming and you find
that none of your key fobs are working
don''t fare
the frequent last question tells you
what to do
programming nissan key fob starts
by racing all fobs now sometimes it goes
wrong and you find you''ll have no
working fobs but take a deep breath and
don''t panic there''s an easy fix to get
the original key fob working again lets
you know right here that you have to go
through this procedure it depends if you
got stuck at step 13 or step 14. in our
case finish step 14
and so it tells us to hold the original
key
on the start button
for 15 seconds and go through that whole
procedure notice how this light is
flashing when pressed
so that tells us that it''s still in
pairing mode release the start button
with the original key and then i''m going
to hold it there for about 15 seconds
and then i''m going to repeat this three
times
now watch for that security light
all right you''re going to wait 15
seconds
turned
off notice this key registration
complete this key i''ll start the vehicle
again
there we go and we can start over at
step one in the programming process the
trick is getting that security light
to turn on and blink five times
one other item i want to warn about in a
very rare but easy to fix situation
there are some push to start nissan
vehicles that have a fuse titled push
button start
if this fuse had been removed
or was burnt out before programming
begins your vehicle may seem like it
stops working the dashboard lights will
not illuminate
around the push button start there are
some letters the lock acc and on buttons
will not be illuminated to fix this you
simply replace this fuse to get your
original key fob working again and then
you can continue programming
now we also offer a full money back
guarantee so if you try this and it just
doesn''t work for your vehicle
simply email help tomsky.com and we''ll
provide a full refund when you send
everything back with the original
packaging that''s it that''s just how easy
it is to use this simple key programming
kit from tomsky.com
to make yourself a new fob for your
nissan and infinity vehicles please
visit our website we''ve got lots of
different kits available as i said at
the beginning we also have vehicles that
program keys for regular turnkey start
vehicles like this
in addition to these smart fobs finally

today i''m going to show you how you can
program smart key for your nissan or
infinity car
right now i have only one key for my
nissan altima and that''s a very
dangerous situation
if i would like to make a copy of my
smart key it would cost me about eighty
dollars
but if i lose my one and only key i
would have to tow my car to the dealer
and pay them up to six hundred dollars
to make a brand new key
it''s very easy to lose your key and
that''s happened to me in the past
once i was fishing and i accidentally
dropped my key
it fell between the cracks into the
water and it was gone
luckily i had the spare key for that car
and my wife brought it to me
and that''s why you want to make a copy
of your smart key as soon as possible

hey what''s up youtube how''s everybody
doing
so today i have a really cool video that
i want to show you guys
so right here we have a key for a 2013
through 2015
nissan altima and what i want to show
you guys today
is how to go ahead and create one of
these universal
prox keys by x-force using your keto max
so the first thing you want to do is
make sure you put a battery in here
okay you can tell that the battery is in
here but
there''s a little light''s gonna be
flashing
so we''re gonna go ahead to vehicle
remote from the main menu
actually first let''s go ahead and read
this chip
okay go ahead and read the transponder
so as you guys can see it says pcf79384a
okay so we''re going to go ahead
and generate it to the nissan
altima smart key or peroxi
okay
go ahead
these songs right here so we''re gonna go
ahead
and we''re gonna go to our remote we''re
gonna go to ultima
and then the one that we actually won is
2013 2015
key let''s go okay it looks like this
this is a generic aftermarket as you
guys can see it doesn''t have a logo
but this is a regular design and this is
a new design okay
so we''re gonna go ahead and we''re gonna
select 2013 through 2015.
let''s go it tells you that you shouldn''t
have a battery
to remove the battery but that doesn''t
apply to this
okay if you don''t have a battery in here
it''s not going to read it so you need a
battery in here so don''t pay attention
to this
so make sure you have a battery in here
and we''re going to go ahead and press
generate remote
right now what the key2 max is doing is
detecting it
this might take from three to four or
five minutes
for it to finish generating okay
quick little shout out if you guys want
to get um sweet deals
on keys or need any type of inventory go
ahead and hit up my voice
at uhs hardware okay
locksmith supplier that''s a number
that''s a website check them out you guys
so as you guys can see it generated once
now it''s generating again
okay so it''s not done
generating the key fully
now the thing i like about this
universal keys
is that you can have one or two of these
and then generate it
with whatever vehicle list them ketomax
gives you
if the vehicle is not on here if the
vehicle is not on here
chances are that the keto max cannot
program it or generate the remote
okay so if it''s not on here it cannot do
it
so whatever keys are right here is the
key that it''s gonna let you generate
if you guys have any questions email me
right now we''re waiting on this remote
this one also has a slot up here where
you can put the emergency
emergency blade like this one so after
it''s done generating this little light''s
going to flash you guys letting you guys
know that it generated successfully
so make sure that you see a little light
flash okay you guys
okay so we''re gonna go ahead and press
complete took about two or three minutes
to do that
so we''re done generating it let me show
you guys a little slot where it''s at
if you guys press this button
and as you guys can see has a little
slot right here for your emergency
blades
what you put right there is you put your
flip key blade
right there and then you put a little
roll pinch hold it in and
you can go ahead and and use your your
emergency
right here let me see if you have it
backwards
yep you guys can see
i hold your emergency key in there
and you guys can turn these into every
vehicle list that the mojito max gives
you
okay so these are the universal so now
we''re done generating
our universal prox key we''re going to go
ahead and program into the vehicle
using our key2 max and our mini obd okay
so follow me let''s go do that now
all right guys so we are in the vehicle
now we''re going to program the new
universal smart key there''s a customer''s
original key
i don''t know don''t ask me so i actually
ended up
connecting the keyboard supplied with
from the max kits to the mini obd
so i believe it was just lack of power i
can''t think the car was getting any
power so i connected to the cable
so we''re going to go to immo programming
we''re going down to
nissan it should be really simple for
you guys
we''re going to select nissan now we''re
going to go by system okay because they
don''t have the model they don''t have the
the model of this vehicle in there we''re
going to smart
now we''re gonna go to 20 digit pin okay
you guys remember that 20 digit pin
and we''re gonna go to type one okay
after 2013
we''re gonna press start it''s loading
we''re going to go to smart key program
smart key switch ignition off turn on
double flash lights
so the double flashlight is actually the
emergency lights you guys
so we''re going to press ok all keys will
be clear so you guys all the keys
are going to be erased so make sure you
have all your keys with you that want to
program
this is the customer''s original key
we''re going to pre-program
we''re going to press yes we''re clearing
all the keys you guys heard the car
beeped
that means that the keys were cleared so
keep pressing the start button until the
ignition is on so this is the tricky
part
just make sure you hold the start button
hold it don''t let it go until it''s on
as you guys can see you guys can let it
go now we''re gonna press okay
turn off ignition switch let''s go ahead
and turn it off

start button with the logo
of the first smart key so we''re gonna go
ahead and we''re gonna program
our universal smart key we''re gonna go
ahead and press it and hold it

once when it beeps repeatedly that means
that it didn''t accept
the key okay so we''re going to go ahead
we''re going to press it
so you guys heard it beeped like crazy
that means it didn''t accept it
we''re gonna use the next key
perfect so all you got to do is just
turn off the button

the proxy key works perfect our mosquito
is beeping so it''s
telling us um don''t forget our mini obd

that
okay we''re gonna check the original key
make sure the original key is programmed
as well
original key is programmed as well
this vehicle fortunately um the signal
to pick up the
perox key is broken so the way they
actually do it is um
they put it near the start button and
they push it
you guys can see the program
successfully as well
so thank you guys for watching if you
guys like this video and helped you guys
out
make sure you hit like and subscribe to
my channel for more cool videos
okay until next time you guys take care
okay guys i want to show you a
co-function you guys
so when we select our key right here and
the menu will generate our key and we go
to mod if we go to modify this button
distance
we can actually switch the buttons
around so right now i programmed this
key
and the trunk button was actually the
panic button
okay so actually the little red one
there''s a trunk button
so what i did was i ended up just
switching the numbers as you guys can
see right here it says trunk
well first we got to actually read it
okay we''re going to read ours our smart
care proxy
and all the information is pop out right
here as you guys can see
everything is correct now but before our
trunk was zero one
the panic button and the panic button
was zero two so all i did was
i went and i changed this to a number to
number two
as you guys can see okay change it to
we press okay then we go to the panic
one
and this one we change it to number one
as you guys can see
okay which into number one we press ok
and all we got to do is put the remote
back in here and then we press
right and it fixes the button so if your
buttons are backwards
with each other all you got to do is
switch them around okay and you guys
should be good
as you guys can see our panic button is

program a Nissan key fob and the key
this is a flip style key first you''re
gonna have to get your key cut I''m going
to cut my myself but if you guys don''t
know how to cut a key and get it off the
internet or something then just take it
to your nearest Walmart or Lowe''s or
somewhere like that that will cut the
key for you the reason you''re gonna have
to have the key cut first is because
when you go to program your key fob you
have to have your key munition and you
have to turn your key and it was not cut
yet that is not going to turn your
nishan so I''m gonna go do that first
guys if you cut your key you want to
make sure that it fits in your lock then
actually turns both ways locks and
unlocks and then one check your initial
okay guys what you want to do is make
sure your doors lock put your key and
now nishan mine takes about 12 or 13
times once that clicks you put the key
back in you turn it to acessories and
then you click the lock letting you take
a key back out and lock the door you
open the door and you check the key
problem all right now let''s program the
key all right guys on this next part all
the keys you have to program this car
you''re gonna want to have on hand -
three so gonna want to make sure you
have the keys that you program into the
car on hand so what you good do is we''re
gonna be using the CKD 100 and a Nissan
automatic pincode so what I do want to
do
go ahead and get this all set up I''m
gonna go down to where it says get the
glare off the teeth thing where it says
pincode services so I''m gonna go down to
their raincoat services then try to put
this for both and see it I''m going to
click enter and then I''m gonna go down
to Nissan BCM code you saw BCM code I''m
gonna click enter again and I''m gonna
turn on the ignition and then I''m gonna
click inner again enter one last time
and then I have my pink code right there
so now I''m going to back out of that and
I''m going to go up to immobilize your
system and I''m gonna click enter on the
immobilizer I''m gonna go all the way
down to Nissan Xterra alright so once we
get down to Nissan Xterra we''re gonna
choose Nissan or my med Nissan USA not
Nissan Xterra so we''re gonna click
Nissan USA and then I''m gonna go down to
Nissan Xterra cuz that''s what this
vehicle is
okay now we have Nissan Xterra and
Nissan Xterra the top one is 2003 to
2004 and the bottom one is 2005 to 2007
so I''m gonna go to 2005 to 2007 because
this is an O 7 and then you also got
another Nissan Xterra that''s from 2008
to 2014 but ours is 2007 so I''m going to
click 2007 click enter that tells me how
many tokens it''s going to use I click
enter it asks with gas or diesel I''m
going to click gas then it says turn on
a Nishan nisshin''s already on somebody
to click enter and I''m gonna click 2 on
that and then just lets me know that I''m
going to need the pin code to do this
service I''m going to click ok because I
understand that and then then it asks
for the pin code so I''m going to put in
the pin code 4 7 1 once I get my pin
code entered go ahead and click enter
click enter again
and then turn off click okay and now it
says to put the keys in turn to the on
position not the start position but the
on position within five seconds of each
key so I''m the last key you gonna put in
you started B equals rounding so I''m
going to click enter ask if I want to
save the whatever I''m gonna click now
and I''m done and now let''s test out all
the keys make sure they''re working this
one
sorry something vehicle next key starts
up the vehicle Laskey it starts up the
vehicle so now we got the key fob
programmed and the key program to start

all right first thing we''re going to
verify if everything
works so I know this one is new there''s
no battery
still you can see it''s not making any
noise this one you can lock do that
unlock trunk still
works and make sure everything works far
and
beep alarm works and the remote start
work make sure that one
working um lock it then hold the remote
start start the car all right so
everything works perfectly with this one
so let''s go
ahead lock this
one
and let''s turn it off so let''s go ahead
um go to the km 100 Alro km 100 and
let''s go
ahead we need to generate one of this
smart key Universal
key all right first we''re going to go
ahead open this up and put a battery all
right to open this just press this one
on the
bottom okay this one will slide
out then I think this one
here to pop
open so just going to pry that
out all the BNS are facing down so it
won''t fall apart and it will try to fall
apart on
you but make sure you put it
back
properly so you have this here
and this one I think is 2032 so I''m
going to use a
battery I''m going to open
this
okay then said positive in this side so
the positive which is the flat
one goes
here go and before we close it make sure
that all the buttons
are in proper
position so we''re going to go ahead and
close it
slowly
see you go let''s put it close
it everything is still intact buttons
cuz sometimes it doesn''t get a line
while putting it back
you
see like this one it won''t go straight
because the spring is not centered so
I''m just going to push the
spring just a little
bit so it''s
Center then there you
go that''s it that''s it so that''s close
so now we have battery so you can see
this is not programmed cuz it
doesn''t lock unlock the car so go ahead
close this
one then we''re going to generate this
for a
proper FCC on this one so let''s go ahead
put right here Universal
key and
then going to
make the

Nissan right
here and then the model the
Ultima then year it''s
2013 so that''s the FCC that we have let
me pull it up hold the FCC make sure
it''s right I have a reference
here this one is Ultima
four-door and that''s the
KR 5 S18
44104 so looks like pretty similar and
we''re going to look for a five Bon 1 2 3
5 so I''m going to go down find a five
Buton ones I think 1 2 3 4 five I think
this is the very bottom one is five
button so I''m going to click that
one and then I''m going go
ahead put the
remote the universal key on top of it
and then I''m going to go
ahead generate Universal
key so make sure you have the battery
first before you do the generating the
remote and this might take a little
while so make sure you don''t move it you
don''t have to be really inside the slot
as long as you''re on top of it and that
one is
generating 70%
20% all
right
look that
okay okay now we''re in 100% so you can
see Universal key generation is
completed do you want to continue the
generation that means if you want to
make another one so I''m going to
say
completed continue go
completed if you continue you get
another one you make another one so now
you can go to
emo I''m going to get my
my OB to connect
it to the car now we''re in the car I''m

so if you''ve got a key like this this is
the GMC I''ll put a link where you can
buy these on Amazon for I think they''re
like ten dollars you''ll have to have it
cut I took it to my local locksmith - to
have it this is a pretty easy procedure
just to show you that this is not a
programmed key I''ll put it in you''ll see
the I''m gonna turn it to start and
you''ll see I''ve got the immobilizer
symbol so the vehicle will not start
right now you''ll see where it says theft
deterrent system so the key is not
programmed so all you do to program
these yourself is you take a programmed
key you can also do this if you have
lost your keys it''s a 30-minute
procedure I could possibly do another
video like that if enough people need to
see that most people have at least one
key they just want a spare key so order
one of these for $10 off Amazon and you
can do it yourself
no no scanner required no machine
required no locksmith or dealer required
to do this you can do it yourself so all
you do take your original key put it in
turn it on
to the run position you don''t have to
start the vehicle you''ll see that the
immobilizer light just went out
turn the key off within five seconds put
the new key on turn it on wait about
five seconds the immobilizer light
should go off turn the key off and that
said start and that''s all there is to it
that''s the one nice thing about GM
products is they allow you to do this
yourself with no with no problem so
again I''ll put a link this is an actual
factory GMC key that you can get off
Amazon it''s not a some oddball
aftermarket all you''ll have to do it''ll
come uncut you''ll just need to have a
locksmith or four dealer cut it

now this particular procedure fits many
different vehicles if you''re unsure what
procedure your vehicle takes you can
visit our web-site program auto keys
comm so a couple things before we get
into it the first thing is this
procedure is gonna be if you''ve lost all
the keys for your vehicle when you do
this when you program in this new key it
will erase any that you''ve previously
had so this is gonna be for all keys
lost if you need to just add a key
without erasing your old ones we''ve
actually done that video before and I''ll
put that the first link in the
description box of the video so we''ve
got that covered the next thing we need
to do is make sure we have our blade cut
this is a new key unprogrammed but you
need to have the blade cut all your two
places your two options for that are
gonna be a dealership or an automotive
locksmith so once we have those two
things
the third thing being you need to lot
yourself about thirty minutes this is a
timed procedure it''s gonna take you
probably 30 to 35 minutes so just make
sure you have your enough time before
you start um so I think that should do
it once we have ourselves to that point
where we have our new unprogrammed key
with the blade cut we can get into the
next step okay so now we''re ready to

and then I have a phone here that I''m
gonna use the time myself so what we
need to do is go ahead and put the key
in the ignition turn to the on position
and we''re gonna leave it in the on
position so now I''m gonna go ahead and
press start here this first part is
gonna take ten minutes and what we''re
gonna be looking at actually is for the
security light to go at and the security
light is that right there so at about
the ten minute mark that light is gonna
go off so we''re at about 17 seconds here
I''ll go ahead and check back in once we
get closer to the ten minute mark okay
so we''re getting close to our 10 minute
mark here or go ahead and just we''re
actually at 9:50 so we''re gonna keep an
eye on this security light here again
we''re waiting for that to go out
as you saw there it just turned off so
now you want to take your ignition and
turn it to off I''m gonna turn it back to
on leave back on and we''re gonna do the
exact same thing we''ll go ahead and
reset our timer and we''ll see you in
another 10 minutes so we''re coming up on
our second ten minute mark we''re at
about nine minutes 50 seconds now the
light just turned off so we''re gonna
turn it to off turn the back to on and
we need to do it one more time reset our
timer and we''ll see in 10 minutes so now
we''re getting into our third and final
ten minute mark and before we get there
and you just want to give you guys a
heads up that on the security light on
the third time it may look a little
different instead of just going out it
may flash once it may keep flashing
repeatedly or it may just simply go out
the main thing you want to keep an eye
on is your ten minute mark and then just
look for a change in the security light
so now we reached our third and final
ten minute mark so now we''re gonna turn
our key to off we''re going to turn it to
on and now our key should be programmed
let''s go ahead just take the key out and
start it to test and you kind of notice
there I''ve noticed when you first
program in the new key you almost have
to start it it feels like for an extra
second or two hold it cranked forward so

for a chevy silverado or other gm

left is the one that''s being replaced
it''s pretty worn down
a lot of times these keys will work fine
in the door
but not work in the ignition and over
time
they''ll all tend to wear down a lot and
not work anymore
so you could just go to your dealership
and ask them for the key code
based on your bin and get a a very
accurate new key made for your car
usually it''s pretty cheap only about 30
bucks
you''re going to want to check the dash
and just confirm that it has a service
theft deterrent system message so
what we''re going to do is set a timer
for 10 minutes
you''re going to have to do this sequence
three times for a total of about 30
minutes

you''ll notice after 10 minutes the
security icon turns off
make sure that you wait about five to
ten seconds
in between doing each of these cycles
that''s your cue to turn the car off
again and wait five to ten seconds
and start it over again and turn the car
on again

a GM ignition key programming procedure
now this particular procedure fits many
different vehicles if you''re unsure what
procedure your vehicle takes you can
visit our web-site program auto keys
comm so a couple things before we get
into it the first thing is this
procedure is gonna be if you''ve lost all
the keys for your vehicle when you do
this when you program in this new key it
will erase any that you''ve previously
had so this is gonna be for all keys
lost if you need to just add a key
without erasing your old ones we''ve
actually done that video before and I''ll
put that the first link in the
description box of the video so we''ve
got that covered the next thing we need
to do is make sure we have our blade cut
this is a new key unprogrammed but you
need to have the blade cut all your two
places your two options for that are
gonna be a dealership or an automotive
locksmith so once we have those two
things
the third thing being you need to lot
yourself about thirty minutes this is a
timed procedure it''s gonna take you
probably 30 to 35 minutes so just make
sure you have your enough time before
you start um so I think that should do
it once we have ourselves to that point
where we have our new unprogrammed key
with the blade cut we can get into the
next step okay so now we''re ready to
started we have our new on programs key
and then I have a phone here that I''m
gonna use the time myself so what we
need to do is go ahead and put the key
in the ignition turn to the on position
and we''re gonna leave it in the on
position so now I''m gonna go ahead and
press start here this first part is
gonna take ten minutes and what we''re
gonna be looking at actually is for the
security light to go at and the security
light is that right there

light is gonna go off so we''re at about

have a 2015 silverado
okay chevrolet silverado when the dock
is lost we''re going to go ahead and
remove
the ignition lock cylinder get the key
cool from there
we''re going to use our keto our keto max
and our dolphin to cut out the key code
and we''re going to use our auto pro pad
to program the key
okay make sure you subscribe hit like
right now go ahead
if you guys are liking this video so far
all right guys so the first thing we''re
gonna do is remove this plastic okay
there''s no screws holding it all you
gotta do is just pull it off
and it should come off okay
i''m gonna go ahead and remove it and
then get back to you okay
okay so this plastic comes off from the
top there''s no screws on it holding it
down
and now we''re left with the ignition
lock cylinder housing
as you guys can see there''s a little
hole up here
that''s the hole we''re gonna use to
maneuver to take this out
okay to pull this out now the way this
toe goes in
okay
this is the side that it goes in okay
this little stick is facing that way
like a scorpion
and then it goes in and you''re gonna
push it down maybe like an inch or two
and try to turn it around okay
so as you guys can see we turn that
around we turn the scorpion around
okay now this is the tricky part we''re
gonna have to feel where the little lock
is at and at the same time
we''re gonna go ahead and pull this out
so just fill the little lockers out do
it
pull it your way this way okay like if
the scorpion''s attacking you
and we''re gonna pull this out okay
so as you guys can see i already
i''m already able to pull it out okay
so just make sure that you guys take it
out slowly
okay now the pink coat you guys
the pink coat is not gonna be on this
part it''s actually inside there
so you have to use this piece to take it
out okay so all you got to do is just
put it in there turn it to the on
position
show you guys you stick it in there
you turn it to the on position with the
end
now while it''s in the on position we''re
gonna get this little piece of metal
and as you guys can see there''s that
little plastic top we''re going to put
this
right here
[Music]
so it pushes that little plastic tub up
okay you have a little tab
as you guys can see it''s holding it up
so it lets you pull out or you can use a
little screwdriver to hold that up
while you''re pulling it out and that
easily comes out okay so that has a key
coat on there
not this okay just be careful with this
part because this part will fly out
that''s spring loaded all right
so as you guys can see i have a little
tail piece in here and the kiko''s
variant on here
okay as you guys can see that''s that''s
the keycard right there
you can''t really see it but it''s in
little dots
okay so that''s going to be the key code
all right you guys so if you guys don''t
know what key code it is um i recommend
you guys get this book
it''s the it''s called the auto truck
keyblank reference by elko
all right and as you guys can see we
have our our model right there silverado
2015 as you guys can see the series the
chord series starts with a v
so you''re going to find the letter v and
four digits okay
and you guys can see it uses it tells
you what k uses
v119 pt tells you the service key it
tells you what programmers you can
program it with okay
all right you guys so we got our key
code now we''re going to go to our max q2
and our dolphin
make sure you connect the first via
bluetooth
go ahead and click on it as you guys can
see i''m disconnected and i''m connecting
now as you guys can see i''m on wi-fi so
you guys are going to enter it for this
then we''re going to go to all keys lost
we''re going to look for chevrolet we''re
going to click on that
and you guys can see a picture of how
the key code is supposed to be
starts with a letter z and has four
numbers in it
okay depending on what vehicles you have
the first letter is gonna be different
so it''s it''s calculated right now
and as you guys can see it tells us to
go to use clamp m2
on side a okay stop at the tip put a new
key in there
here''s our cut for our vehicle then
we''re going to go to cut key
and we''re going to continue okay
after we''re done cutting it we can go
ahead and program into the vehicle
do
okay so if you guys want to put this
back together um you got to make sure
you attach the top piece to it first
okay like so
also when you guys are putting in the
the ignition lock cylinder
you guys got to make sure that the
ignition switch is on
okay and put the whole thing together
okay so when you guys are putting the
switch back on make sure that you put
the key in there
and you turn this little piece okay that
this little piece
aligns with that little piece okay so
that it got going smoothly
as you guys can see
and i went in smoothly as you guys can
see
okay so just make sure you align those
two and put the tail piece in or it''s
not going to go in smooth okay
as long as you have you have this thing
aligned
it''ll go in small like butter
and then we could just put our cover
back on okay
okay guys so we have our ignition switch
we have our key return we have our
ignition
switch on we''re gonna go to
usgm we''re gonna agree

this newer chevy''s we''re going to go to
bcm
read pin code as
it says scan 2 is going to red pin do
you want to continue yes
so right now it''s going to read the pin
that we need so in order to program a
key
or do anything you need to read the pins
first okay
so it''s right in the pan just bear with
it''s communicating give it a minute
you guys have any questions you know in
the comment section below
okay so as you guys can see
there''s our pin right there 7960 okay
we''re gonna press okay that''s our bin

introduce you to my 2014 Chevrolet
Silverado work truck and if it weren''t
for a work truck I wouldn''t be on here
today to show you a tutorial on how to
install key fobs for the truck
as you can see there is no key files
with this truck but that''ll change here
today because I got something on the
inside that will be able to program new
key fobs for the truck without bringing
it to a dealer the pricing is only about
50 to 70 dollars for the first fob
second fob could be as low cost as 20 to
30 dollars we got on the left is a
doorman brand remote and then on the
inside a programmer that will allow me
to program this remote to the truck
without having to bring it to the dealer
which will save you a lot of time and
money and then on the right is a
secondary key fob for my second spare
key this truck came with no key fobs and
I figured I''d have them installed with
the price I was able to get these for
and I heard that this programmer is only
good for three or five uses when you''re
programming all your remotes at once
it''s good for a Sierra Silverado
suburban and Yukon of these years 2014
2015 or 2014 to 2016 Silverado
and 2014 is an odd year with these
trucks because in 2015 is whenever they
switched over the 2500s but in 2014 is
whenever they switched them over to
these more Square looking trucks which I
think has a nice appearance so we''re
going to be trying to install these here
today it''s the first time this truck has
probably ever had fobs and about eight
years of its existence let''s see if this
packaging will open pleasantly I''ve
always had certain experiences with this
kind of Packaging
one key fob instructions
and programmer
device may cause harmful interference
and this device must accept any
interference received including
interference that may cause undesired
operation as limited number of uses
depending on application see they set
the limited number of uses that way you
have to buy a new one but that does a
lot of E-Waste and I think these are
considered something that could be
recycled at a Best Buy or somewhere that
recycle electronics a lot of E-Waste
they should have make an unlimited uses
or if anyone knows how to make them and
set them to unlimited uses let us know
now if you''re looking to go the same
route I would there''s the park number on
the top right
99355 disclaimer all currently
programmed and new remotes must be
programmed to vehicle please have all
remotes in hand at the time programming
and I have the door closed and my
seatbelt on to reduce the door chime
whenever I turn the key let''s get
started and hopefully try to get it on
the first go that way I don''t use one of
the uses on the remote just in case I
want to reprogram other remotes or I
don''t get them all programmed in the
first go which has happened a few times
with the other vehicle I had and I lost
some of the uses let''s try to get on the
first go I''m going to turn the key to
the on position without starring the
engine that''s one turn and then a second
turn
okay
okay that should light up all the gauges
I''m going to turn the radio off
then I got the key programmer here
insert this into the OBD2 port which is
down at the bottom of the truck
should be about right here
what''s it do you got it upside down okay
remote key learning active on the dash
press and hold lock and unlock on the
first key fob
[Music]
okay you hear that beep that''s the first
one second fob quick
and that''s the second one turn off and
remove key from ignition
unless you have any other key fobs of
course
okay and now you''re safe to remove the
programmer from the OBD2
and there you and there you have it both
key fobs should be programmed
repeat procedure for all remotes that
are not properly working let''s test them
out
how about that
there we go on a truck that has never
had key fobs in its life in almost a
decade now has working key fobs
and wow makes certainly makes a
difference whenever you got stuff in the
back seat and look at the cap of this
you''re probably carrying things around
if you''ve got a crew cab you gotta
unlock your doors whenever you get out
and then you can get to your back seat
and then you have to reopen the front
door just to lock the whole truck again
this will Streamlight the process make
it a lot easier might enter for your
phone might interfere with your vehicle
might interfere with planes going across
the sky here we go we now got two keys
and two key fobs all functional for this
truck and I drove this truck from the
west coast to the east coast and it was
a significantly long trip without having
key fobs talk about a blast from the
past out in the old west
let''s see oh there we go with the noise
I''ll try to see what I can do about that
pull the key out lock these doors
there we go and I know I got the key
with me I should have locked it in the
truck I''m gonna just use the fob and see
if I can get in now
and I''m going to go straight to the back
seat because I haven''t been able to do
that ever
we are in the truck
foreign
brand fob is significantly lighter than
the GM I''m not sure of the quality
difference it seems to be functional and
I''ve installed the doorman on the
previous truck and that seemed to work
well I think the batteries are the same
too and that is installing a key fob on
your 2014 2015 or 2016 Silverado this
also works on the Yukons and Suburbans I
think there was one other on the list
hope you guys enjoyed it was a very
simple install very low cost a little
enhancement to your vehicle the
instructions in the back of the
programmer too in a wise individual once
said let there be key fobs or key free

how to install a new key fob
for your 2011 to 2013 silverado and up
everything from about 2011 to present
day you''re gonna need a special device
to be able to
program a new key fob for your truck
everything lower than that there was a
setting in the truck you just press a
button and boom
you can program a new key pop to your
truck without her today because i have a
and all vehicles today you need a
certain program or you have to go to the
dealership to program a new key phone
new key fobs at the dealership can run
you up to 300 400
especially for the ones that have the
push to start feature luckily i just
have a turnkey
and it was low cost to find this option
i saw this option for this product at
an advanced auto power search in this
package of many shop edges lies the
product you are looking for right here
gm
2011 the 2015 they make ones that are
2015 to present day
that is also stated in 2020 2021 2022
20 40 and beyond looks almost oem but
you can tell by just the buttons alone
and then on the back
you got the programmer plugging in the
obd2 port it''s only good for about three
to five uses because they want to limit
you that way they can sell more products
but then that contributes to more
e-waste which doesn''t make sense to me
there are many places that take
electronics for recycle and that''s what
i have to do once i use out this product
today i figured
because of the price i had to pick it up
least wasteful option would be going to
your dealership and getting one from
them
now dorman calls it a keyless entry
remote and that''s what we''ll call today
10 minutes installation that may
even be 10 seconds let''s get this open i
already ripped it open up the finger a
couple times but hey we got it out
as i mentioned before if your vehicle is
older than 2011 especially a jam
would have been a button that you can
press right here to program a new key
fob without buying
this unit right here maybe we''ll tamper
in this later see if we can hack the
ecm and try to get 150 more horsepower
of the truck bring him a new file you
have to program all your fobs at the
same time in a d
program as any other fobs now let''s get
started to programming the new
key fob for your truck first step is to
close the
door and then lock all the doors to your
vehicle
insert your existing key into the
ignition and
turn power to the truck without starting
the next step is to locate your obd2
port
which should be right by the pedal area
of your truck or car is that not going
in there
once the program is inserted wait for a
chime or red lights on the programmer to
come on this will indicate that the unit
is ready to program the first remote
hold the lock and unlock button of the
first fob
[Music]
that''s done second of all press and hold
the lock and unlock pawn on the remote
simultaneously until you hear a chime
buzzer of the door lock
cycle when all remotes are programmed
wait 60 seconds for the buzz of the
sound continuously then remove the
programmer from the obd2 port
there it is now you can pull the unit
out of your obd2 port
and to show you my level of confidence
with this device i''m going to roll my
windows up
press the lock button truck is locked
hmm the wind is picking up strong only
using my brand new key fob and walk up
to the truck and we''re gonna
open it oh works great well last but not
least i''m going to try the panic button
and see if that is now working with the
truck on the new key fob
right now okay works
it works we got it we got it and i hope

video how to change the key fob or
excuse me the key battery in a Honda
Civic key from 2014 to present the Civic
uses this this key with the rectangular
buttons so if we flip the key over you
can see there''s a little tiny screw
there now what you''re gonna need is not
a just a regular screwdriver but a
little precision screwdriver like this
this set here you get this for four
bucks on Amazon I''ll link to it below
this video so the first time you take
the screw out it''ll be kind of tough
because it''s down pretty low and it''s
pretty tight so just unscrew this I''ve
already kind of loosened it so this is
gonna go a lot quicker than it might for
you your first time but you really have
to push down to get this screw out so
once you''ve gotten that out drop that
out and then on this side here you''ll
notice there''s a little slot go ahead
and take a flathead screwdriver take
this large flat one from your set and
stick it in the side there and if you
kind of twist it''ll start to break apart
and break apart but there''s two pieces
to this clamshell fob and you can start
if you just kind of twist you''ll be able
to pop off the top of the key here which
was gonna be access to the battery that
we need to change so you can take your
flat-head screwdriver and just pop out
the CR 16 23 volt battery so see that go
ahead there just make sure when you put
another one back in that positive side
is down here and if you if you kind of
put in the top side first like I''m doing
here it''ll go in a lot easier okay so
once you''ve got a new one in go ahead
and just reassemble the fob and put the
two pieces back together a little snap
back together pretty easily and then go
ahead and put your little baby screw
back in and that''s it that''s how you
change key battery on a Honda Civic Bob
flatten so a little tiny Phillips one
and just screw that back in and you''re
all set and again the battery type is a

disconnected somehow and i did change
the battery

first to show you what i''m talking about
okay
so we''ll give it a try on the remote
you see that red blink

this
remote is working and this one is not
so somehow when i did replace the
battery somehow maybe it was
disconnected and i''m gonna start to
reprogram it now
first step is you have to
press the engine start button twice
without uh pressing the brake or else

twice

all right i put a new control unit in
here or master switch and now when you
do that not only does it have to be
programmed but the key fob has to be
programmed as you can see
i''m pressing the buttons it''s not doing
anything
so we need to program this key to the
vehicle again
and uh
it''s pretty simple i''ll show you how now
while i''m thinking of it
if this
if your key fob is not programmed to the
car
if i lock the door and open it or unlock
it and open it from inside
and i i''m not using the lock it''s gonna
think that i broke into the car and it''s
probably gonna set off uh it''s gonna set
off the alarm
you know with the horn
and uh you''re not gonna be able to shut
it off until you program the key and
then hit the unlock button just so you
know and you can program it even with
the security code going off you can
program a key i''ve done it before
so anyway all we''re gonna do right now
it''s in the zero position or off we''re
gonna put the key in and we''re gonna
turn it to the number two position or
the on position
and we''re gonna do that and then i''m
just gonna be pressing you can use
either the unlock or the lock i''m gonna
use the lock button and we''re gonna
press that button in a sequence four
times
so we just have to put the key in we''re
gonna turn it on wait one second
and then hit unlock
now we wait one second
and turn it off
that''s one time
and we turn it back on wait one second
now we hit lock again that''s two
then we turn it off wait a second
turn it back on
hit the lock button again
wait a second
and we turn it off
then we turn it back on
then we hit the lock button again
now we can hear them locked that''s
number four
we hit it again one more time now it
programmed in now if we had additional
keys we could just hit the button and
program them in but we don''t have any
more right now
now we can just turn it off and now
well if i
locked it
see now the keys lock
or it locks and unlocks
i don''t know if you can hear that but
now they''re working
that''s all it takes pretty easy but uh
if you don''t do that step then your key
fob is not going to work so in any event

turn the ignition on still leaving the
same new key in the ignition
and you hear the tune that let us know
it''s successful
so we''re going to turn the engine off
unplug the programmer and check that it
works
okay here we go
there we go wasn''t that easy starts the
engine
let''s check the remote buttons make sure
they work
lock
unlock
trunk and there''s the panic
okay
it''s that easy now i also want to
mention uh the instructions tell you all
about this but if early in the
programming process
the programmer beeps seven times
that means your vehicle already has the
maximum number of keys programmed to it
six keys on this on these honda vehicles
never fear the instructions
teach you how to erase
all except one working key and then you
can follow the same procedure to program
your new keys plus any additional keys
that you may have had before so there
you''ve seen just how easy it is to use
this simple key programmer to make
yourself new keys for honda vehicles go
visit tomsky.com where you can pick up
this simple key kit for your honda and
make keys and save a ton of money over
the cost that the car dealership charges
and if you''re looking for other vehicles
we probably have a kit for that as well
we look forward to helping you make new
hope you have a great day', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', 'Civic', 2018, 2018);

Hey, what''s up? How''s everybody doing?
Welcome to my channel, Mike''s
Automotive. So, today we''re working with
the Honda Civic, you guys. And this is
like 2016 and up for push to start. Now,
the customer had a auto universal remote
pro into the vehicle.
And the thing is that it was kind of
working. It turns on the car when it
wants to. It doesn''t turn on. Sometimes
it does. So, she''s like, "Hey, I''m just
going to get an OEM smart key and just
go ahead and program it." So, I said,
"All right." So, we''re going to be using
our auto. Go ahead and make sure you
have your uh emergency lights on if you
can''t turn it on. If you can turn it on,
turn it on. Okay. Now, um we''re going to
go to automatic uh VIN scan. So, it''s
going to automatically search for the
vehicle using the VIN. Um like I said,
if you can turn it on, turn it on. We''re
going to select smart key.
We''re going to do a push to start. Okay?
Because it''s push to start.
Um, as you guys can see, there''s
information right there for Civic.
Um, we''re going to We always go through
MMO status scan just because it it does
the the scan of the MMO system and it
lets us know something''s wrong with it
um or anything. So, it says is ignition
turned on by pressing the start button.
If you can turn it on, yes. If you can
press no.
So, um, we''re going to go ahead and scan
it. You guys can see it has the smart
system on here and then the immo system.
So, the smart system would be like
anything that''s keyless, any modules
that are that can pick it up, you know,
the immo system, of course, is the
immobilizer system that immobilizes a
vehicle if it''s not the correct key. So,
um, we''re going to go through all keys
lost. Actually, if you have a key, you
can go through add a key, but I''m going
to go through all keys lost because at
the end of the day, their key didn''t
want to turn on the car and off when it
needed to. And this requires you to turn
on and off the car. So, it says to place
the key to be learned in the vehicle and
take all the other keys out.
Is the ignition turned on by pressing
on? Um, no. We can''t turn it on. So,
we''re going to press no. It says press
and hold the start button. So, we''re
going to press and hold the start button
until the until the ignition uh turns on
and the cluster turns on and all the
lights, everything kind of like
accessory mode.
Um, is ignition switched on? Please
release the ignition. We''re going to
press okay.
Okay, here''s the next step. whether it''s
a newer model generally refers to after
2020. We''re going to press no because
it''s not over 2020. It''s like 16 through
18.
Now it''s establish establishing vehicle
communication.
Okay. Checking condition of the vehicle.
Please wait.
Keep program success. Would you like to
program the next one?
Press yes if you have another one. Press
no if you don''t have another one. So
it''s telling us to press the start
button.
Okay, to turn it off.
Now it says to turn it on. So basically
for all Honda, this is how it is. Turn
it off. Turn it on.
So you might have to um
Okay. Are both the keys
keyless? Is indicator immobilizer light
off? Yes, it''s off. We''re going to press
yes. Now again, it''s going to tell us to
shut it off. So, we''re going to press
it.
Now, it says to turn it on. Okay. Now,
now you''re going to have to press it
twice to turn it on every time you press
it. So, press it twice to turn it off
and once, excuse me, press it twice to
turn it on and once to turn it off. As
you guys can see, the registration is
complete. Okay, turn it off. Press it
once to turn it off. Now, don''t put your
foot on the brake, okay? Like, do not
start the actual vehicle. It just wants
you to put it in accessory mode. As you
guys can see, excuse me, it''s
programmed. The remote works. Everything
works perfectly. Um, please don''t forget

show you how to change the key battery
for a Honda CRV this is batteries used
from 2014 to present in the physical key
so you flip the key over you can see
there''s a really small screw on the
backside of a key now to get this out
you''re gonna need a very small
screwdriver so I have a precision
screwdriver here I said also known as
kind of like a jeweler set you I got
this for four bucks you can find these
on Amazon I''ll link to it below the
video here but the real handy here
because you do need a very small
screwdriver to get this this screw out
so let me just get this out real quick
the first time you do this it can be
difficult I''ve already losing this one
so it''s gonna be pretty easy for me here
but the first time you do this you may
have to press down really hard to get to
get some traction into that screw okay
so go ahead and pop that thing off and
then if you look at the side of the key
fob there''s kind of a little notch if
you take a flathead screwdriver right
into that notch and twist I''ll give you
some some leverage to be able to pop off
the two sections of the fob and once you
get that apart and it''ll come apart
pretty easily so don''t worry about
breaking anything there as long as you
stay in the notch and kind of twist
around it''ll be good to get this part so
now you can see we have access to the
pad right in here just take our flat
head just gently pop out let''s see our
1623 volt coin battery so once you have
a new one of these just make sure the
positive side is facing down and push it
in kind of keep it towards the top here
when you first push it in because
there''s kind of some prongs down at the
bottom so let''s make it easier once
you''ve got that in make sure that you
don''t see any positive signs or
lettering facing you so you got the
right side in there and then go ahead
and reassemble the table just place
those two pieces back together and it''ll
snap together real nice and easy and
then go ahead and replace your little
little baby screw and that''s it so
that''s how you change the key fob

all right i put a new control unit in
here or master switch and now when you
do that not only does it have to be
programmed but the key fob has to be
programmed as you can see
i''m pressing the buttons it''s not doing
anything
so we need to program this key to the
vehicle again
and uh
it''s pretty simple i''ll show you how now
while i''m thinking of it
if this
if your key fob is not programmed to the
car
if i lock the door and open it or unlock
it and open it from inside
and i i''m not using the lock it''s gonna
think that i broke into the car and it''s
probably gonna set off uh it''s gonna set
off the alarm
you know with the horn
and uh you''re not gonna be able to shut
it off until you program the key and
then hit the unlock button just so you
know and you can program it even with
the security code going off you can
program a key i''ve done it before
so anyway all we''re gonna do right now
it''s in the zero position or off we''re
gonna put the key in and we''re gonna
turn it to the number two position or
the on position
and we''re gonna do that and then i''m
just gonna be pressing you can use
either the unlock or the lock i''m gonna
use the lock button and we''re gonna
press that button in a sequence four
times
so we just have to put the key in we''re
gonna turn it on wait one second
and then hit unlock
now we wait one second
and turn it off
that''s one time
and we turn it back on wait one second
now we hit lock again that''s two
then we turn it off wait a second
turn it back on
hit the lock button again
wait a second
and we turn it off
then we turn it back on
then we hit the lock button again
now we can hear them locked that''s
number four
we hit it again one more time now it
programmed in now if we had additional
keys we could just hit the button and
program them in but we don''t have any
more right now
now we can just turn it off and now
well if i
locked it
see now the keys lock
or it locks and unlocks
i don''t know if you can hear that but
now they''re working
that''s all it takes pretty easy but uh
if you don''t do that step then your key
fob is not going to work so in any event

the right light stay on for a while, but

will show you a few tricks to fix it.
First, to replace Honda CRV, the key
batteries. The batteries you need is a
CR1620. The tools you need Philip
screwdrivers and a flat screwdriver. You
unscrew it.
Use the flat screwdriver gently pry
open and then use the flat screwdriver
to pry out
battery. Install the new battery.
Put it in. If it doesn''t work after you
replace battery, you need to clean it.
So, I need to take off
this, take off the rubber
boot, and then I used air duster to blow
the duster away.
[Music]
And then I used the contact cleaner to
clean the three buttons related circuit.
I leave the links in the description
below if you need a contact cleaner or
air
duster. I reassembled the key for
test. After you replace battery and
clean the key, if it work,
congratulation. If you''re not, you need
to reprogram your key. Enter the
vehicle, lock all the doors, and turn
the key to the two position or on
position. And then press and hold lock
or unlock key for a few
seconds and then press another key and
hold and then press another key
again. You can also uh use the so-called
formal way. You turn the key to the on
position. Press and hold one second and
then turn to the off position. Repeat
this another two times and then you turn
to the on position. Press unlock key and
wait for the door to unlock. Test inside
the car to see the signal pairing. And
then test outside of a
car. Lock it. It''s locked. Press

today we''re going to take a look at how
to replace the battery in this Honda
Pilot smart key remote fob this Honda
Pilot key fob is going to use
replacement battery CR
2032 and I''ll put a link in the
description box of this video to where
you can find these replacement batteries
if you''re in
need so the first thing I''m going to do
is grab my key fob and remove the
emergency key that''s in the bottom of it
that''s done by pressing this release on
the back of the fob that my thumb''s on
and the key will pull out like that now
I''m going to use this key to open this
key fob case and I actually prefer to
use a flathead screwdriver it works a
little bit better but I''m going to show
you how to do it with just the key in
case that''s all you have so taking a
look at the bottom of our key fob see
these two pieces right here that kind of
look like the letter e what I''m going to
do is take my key and put it in between
those two pieces like that then I''m just
going to
pry like that and as you can see it
opens the case and I''m holding the key
fob up like this for a better camera
angle but as you do this try to keep
your buttons facing down and that will
help keep them in
place so once we get that popped off
there go ahead and pull it the rest of
the way apart with your hands like that
now we see our battery right here and
I''m going to use this key to get under
the edge of the
battery and pop it out of that holder
and again for that part Works a flathead
screwdriver does work better for that as
well but once we get our old battery out
we can grab our new battery and we want
to make sure that we''re installing our
new battery with the plus side up
positive side up and you want to tuck
that edge in
first like that and then snap it down
into place and we can snap the two
halves back
together slide our emergency key back in

all right i put a new control unit in
here or master switch and now when you
do that not only does it have to be
programmed but the key fob has to be
programmed as you can see
i''m pressing the buttons it''s not doing
anything
so we need to program this key to the
vehicle again
and uh
it''s pretty simple i''ll show you how now
while i''m thinking of it
if this
if your key fob is not programmed to the
car
if i lock the door and open it or unlock
it and open it from inside
and i i''m not using the lock it''s gonna
think that i broke into the car and it''s
probably gonna set off uh it''s gonna set
off the alarm
you know with the horn
and uh you''re not gonna be able to shut
it off until you program the key and
then hit the unlock button just so you
know and you can program it even with
the security code going off you can
program a key i''ve done it before
so anyway all we''re gonna do right now
it''s in the zero position or off we''re
gonna put the key in and we''re gonna
turn it to the number two position or
the on position
and we''re gonna do that and then i''m
just gonna be pressing you can use
either the unlock or the lock i''m gonna
use the lock button and we''re gonna
press that button in a sequence four
times
so we just have to put the key in we''re
gonna turn it on wait one second
and then hit unlock
now we wait one second
and turn it off
that''s one time
and we turn it back on wait one second
now we hit lock again that''s two
then we turn it off wait a second
turn it back on
hit the lock button again
wait a second
and we turn it off
then we turn it back on
then we hit the lock button again
now we can hear them locked that''s
number four
we hit it again one more time now it
programmed in now if we had additional
keys we could just hit the button and
program them in but we don''t have any
more right now
now we can just turn it off and now
well if i
locked it
see now the keys lock
or it locks and unlocks
i don''t know if you can hear that but
now they''re working
that''s all it takes pretty easy but uh
if you don''t do that step then your key
fob is not going to work so in any event

programmed to your car is click the link
to our website down below in the

car remote and car key page if you just
search for your year year make and model
of car if it''s on board programmable
that means you can program it yourself
you''re going to see a little programming
tab right there click on that tab
that''ll have the directions for your
specific year make and model if you
don''t see that tab that means you cannot
do the programming on your own you''re
going to have to hire somebody like
locksmith to take care of it for you now
with those directions right there just
print them out stick them in your glove
box you''ll have them forever there is
one got you here that I should address
and that is car key remote combos if
your key looks something like that in
the image here a lot of times when they
combined those keys and remotes together
in one unit they actually kept the
electronics separate so you may see
programming directions for the remote
that don''t apply to the key so if you go
through those instructions to program
the key to your car and the remote works
it locks it unlocks the doors but the
car won''t start with the key or the car
starts and dies after just a few seconds
that means that that key needs to be
programmed separately by somebody that
can do that take it into a locksmith

all right i put a new control unit in
here or master switch and now when you
do that not only does it have to be
programmed but the key fob has to be
programmed as you can see
i''m pressing the buttons it''s not doing
anything
so we need to program this key to the
vehicle again
and uh
it''s pretty simple i''ll show you how now
while i''m thinking of it
if this
if your key fob is not programmed to the
car
if i lock the door and open it or unlock
it and open it from inside
and i i''m not using the lock it''s gonna
think that i broke into the car and it''s
probably gonna set off uh it''s gonna set
off the alarm
you know with the horn
and uh you''re not gonna be able to shut
it off until you program the key and
then hit the unlock button just so you
know and you can program it even with
the security code going off you can
program a key i''ve done it before
so anyway all we''re gonna do right now
it''s in the zero position or off we''re
gonna put the key in and we''re gonna
turn it to the number two position or
the on position
and we''re gonna do that and then i''m
just gonna be pressing you can use
either the unlock or the lock i''m gonna
use the lock button and we''re gonna
press that button in a sequence four
times
so we just have to put the key in we''re
gonna turn it on wait one second
and then hit unlock
now we wait one second
and turn it off
that''s one time
and we turn it back on wait one second
now we hit lock again that''s two
then we turn it off wait a second
turn it back on
hit the lock button again
wait a second
and we turn it off
then we turn it back on
then we hit the lock button again
now we can hear them locked that''s
number four
we hit it again one more time now it
programmed in now if we had additional
keys we could just hit the button and
program them in but we don''t have any
more right now
now we can just turn it off and now
well if i
locked it
see now the keys lock
or it locks and unlocks
i don''t know if you can hear that but
now they''re working
that''s all it takes pretty easy but uh
if you don''t do that step then your key
fob is not going to work so in any event

your key looks something like that in

combined those keys and remotes together
in one unit they actually kept the
electronics separate so you may see
programming directions for the remote
that don''t apply to the key so if you go
through those instructions to program
the key to your car and the remote works
it locks it unlocks the doors but the
car won''t start with the key or the car
starts and dies after just a few seconds

first to show you what i''m talking about
okay
so we''ll give it a try on the remote
you see that red blink
okay it did not start
and
let''s give it another try
it really doesn''t work okay now let''s
try the
this one
you can tell right away
now that you see that
this
remote is working and this one is not
so somehow when i did replace the
battery somehow maybe it was
disconnected and i''m gonna start to
reprogram it now
first step is you have to
press the engine start button twice
without uh pressing the brake or else
you''re going to uh start the car so just
twice
one
two
and then after that you just wait for
the uh
screen to finish
and press okay and then
press the
remote lock five times one two three
four five
and then after that press the lock
at the driver''s uh
door five times one two three four five
unlock the door manually
but before you go out press it once
to turn it off
then we''re going to try
if it works
i think it works already see
see that one
i''ll get the
other remote
the old one that works
here
this is the one that we change uh this
is i mean this is the one that i did
reprogram
and this one
so you can see people works again
let''s try this one this is no one let''s
start it

that putting the key in turn it on
pressing the lock then doing that three
more times and the fourth time you turn
it on I was never able to get my car
doors to lock and unlock what I was
looking for is there''s a light right
here and when I finally got it to work I
actually looked and I turned it on
pressed the lock button a few times
until this light came on that''s when I
started my four
turns and each time I pressed it when I
turned it on all the way pressed the
lock I watched for the light and
sometimes I had to hit it a couple of
times a little
harder and um did that the four times
again my Lo lock and unlock didn''t work
so what I did is I got out of the car
and just walked away a little bit maybe
to get the proximity thing away from the
car and then walk back to it
and hit lock and unlock and started
working so again just that little red
light right there I don''t know if it''s

all right i put a new control unit in
here or master switch and now when you
do that not only does it have to be
programmed but the key fob has to be
programmed as you can see
i''m pressing the buttons it''s not doing
anything
so we need to program this key to the
vehicle again
and uh
it''s pretty simple i''ll show you how now
while i''m thinking of it
if this
if your key fob is not programmed to the
car
if i lock the door and open it or unlock
it and open it from inside
and i i''m not using the lock it''s gonna
think that i broke into the car and it''s
probably gonna set off uh it''s gonna set
off the alarm
you know with the horn
and uh you''re not gonna be able to shut
it off until you program the key and
then hit the unlock button just so you
know and you can program it even with
the security code going off you can
program a key i''ve done it before
so anyway all we''re gonna do right now
it''s in the zero position or off we''re
gonna put the key in and we''re gonna
turn it to the number two position or
the on position
and we''re gonna do that and then i''m
just gonna be pressing you can use
either the unlock or the lock i''m gonna
use the lock button and we''re gonna
press that button in a sequence four
times
so we just have to put the key in we''re
gonna turn it on wait one second
and then hit unlock
now we wait one second
and turn it off
that''s one time
and we turn it back on wait one second
now we hit lock again that''s two
then we turn it off wait a second
turn it back on
hit the lock button again
wait a second
and we turn it off
then we turn it back on
then we hit the lock button again
now we can hear them locked that''s
number four
we hit it again one more time now it
programmed in now if we had additional
keys we could just hit the button and
program them in but we don''t have any
more right now
now we can just turn it off and now
well if i
locked it
see now the keys lock
or it locks and unlocks
i don''t know if you can hear that but
now they''re working
that''s all it takes pretty easy but uh
if you don''t do that step then your key
fob is not going to work so in any event

well so visit tomsky.com where you can
pick one up but first let me show you
how easy this is to use when you get

we''ll give you your money back just

tomsky.com and we can take care of you
okay so in order to begin
you need to
turn to the dial position indicated in
the table
position number one for this honda
accord that we''re working on today we''re
going to take our working key and it''s
important to note you must have a
working key that starts the vehicle to
use our programming equipment you''ll
know which one i have working because
i''ve got this tile key finder on it you
might want to pick one of these up on
our website it pairs to your smartphone
and then you can always find your keys
in case you lose them okay to begin
we''re going to take our working key
and put it in turn two clicks to the on
position
don''t start the engine
then we''re going to take the
easy installer and plug it into the obd2
port
come down by your gas and brake pedal
look up
you''re looking for the obd2 plug like
this
just come and plug it in
you''ll hear the programmer beep so you
know it''s plugged in now i need to take
and press the button
on the end of our programmer
we heard the programmer beep
when it beeps twice you turn the
ignition off and we remove the working
key
it beeped once now we''re going to insert
our new key
and turn it to the on position don''t
start the engine
it beeped twice
that lets us know we can turn the
ignition off do not remove the key
it beeps
turn the ignition on
now wait 10 seconds we''re listening for
it to beep twice
you might notice a blinking green light
okay there it beeped twice
turn the ignition off it''ll beep again
turn the ignition on still leaving the
same new key in the ignition
and you hear the tune that let us know
it''s successful
so we''re going to turn the engine off
unplug the programmer and check that it
works
okay here we go
there we go wasn''t that easy starts the
engine
let''s check the remote buttons make sure
they work
lock
unlock
trunk and there''s the panic
okay
it''s that easy now i also want to
mention uh the instructions tell you all
about this but if early in the
programming process
the programmer beeps seven times
that means your vehicle already has the
maximum number of keys programmed to it
six keys on this on these honda vehicles
never fear the instructions
teach you how to erase
all except one working key and then you
can follow the same procedure to program
your new keys plus any additional keys
that you may have had before so there
you''ve seen just how easy it is to use
this simple key programmer to make
yourself new keys for honda vehicles go
visit tomsky.com where you can pick up
this simple key kit for your honda and
make keys and save a ton of money over
the cost that the car dealership charges
and if you''re looking for other vehicles
we probably have a kit for that as well
we look forward to helping you make new
hope you have a great day', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', 'Civic', 2017, 2017);

Hey, what''s up? How''s everybody doing?
Welcome to my channel, Mike''s
Automotive. So, today we''re working with
the Honda Civic, you guys. And this is
like 2016 and up for push to start. Now,
the customer had a auto universal remote
pro into the vehicle.
And the thing is that it was kind of
working. It turns on the car when it
wants to. It doesn''t turn on. Sometimes
it does. So, she''s like, "Hey, I''m just
going to get an OEM smart key and just
go ahead and program it." So, I said,
"All right." So, we''re going to be using
our auto. Go ahead and make sure you
have your uh emergency lights on if you
can''t turn it on. If you can turn it on,
turn it on. Okay. Now, um we''re going to
go to automatic uh VIN scan. So, it''s
going to automatically search for the
vehicle using the VIN. Um like I said,
if you can turn it on, turn it on. We''re
going to select smart key.
We''re going to do a push to start. Okay?
Because it''s push to start.
Um, as you guys can see, there''s
information right there for Civic.
Um, we''re going to We always go through
MMO status scan just because it it does
the the scan of the MMO system and it
lets us know something''s wrong with it
um or anything. So, it says is ignition
turned on by pressing the start button.
If you can turn it on, yes. If you can
press no.
So, um, we''re going to go ahead and scan
it. You guys can see it has the smart
system on here and then the immo system.
So, the smart system would be like
anything that''s keyless, any modules
that are that can pick it up, you know,
the immo system, of course, is the
immobilizer system that immobilizes a
vehicle if it''s not the correct key. So,
um, we''re going to go through all keys
lost. Actually, if you have a key, you
can go through add a key, but I''m going
to go through all keys lost because at
the end of the day, their key didn''t
want to turn on the car and off when it
needed to. And this requires you to turn
on and off the car. So, it says to place
the key to be learned in the vehicle and
take all the other keys out.
Is the ignition turned on by pressing
on? Um, no. We can''t turn it on. So,
we''re going to press no. It says press
and hold the start button. So, we''re
going to press and hold the start button
until the until the ignition uh turns on
and the cluster turns on and all the
lights, everything kind of like
accessory mode.
Um, is ignition switched on? Please
release the ignition. We''re going to
press okay.
Okay, here''s the next step. whether it''s
a newer model generally refers to after
2020. We''re going to press no because
it''s not over 2020. It''s like 16 through
18.
Now it''s establish establishing vehicle
communication.
Okay. Checking condition of the vehicle.
Please wait.
Keep program success. Would you like to
program the next one?
Press yes if you have another one. Press
no if you don''t have another one. So
it''s telling us to press the start
button.
Okay, to turn it off.
Now it says to turn it on. So basically
for all Honda, this is how it is. Turn
it off. Turn it on.
So you might have to um
Okay. Are both the keys
keyless? Is indicator immobilizer light
off? Yes, it''s off. We''re going to press
yes. Now again, it''s going to tell us to
shut it off. So, we''re going to press
it.
Now, it says to turn it on. Okay. Now,
now you''re going to have to press it
twice to turn it on every time you press
it. So, press it twice to turn it off
and once, excuse me, press it twice to
turn it on and once to turn it off. As
you guys can see, the registration is
complete. Okay, turn it off. Press it
once to turn it off. Now, don''t put your
foot on the brake, okay? Like, do not
start the actual vehicle. It just wants
you to put it in accessory mode. As you
guys can see, excuse me, it''s
programmed. The remote works. Everything
works perfectly. Um, please don''t forget

Hey, what''s up? How''s everybody doing?
Welcome to my channel, Mike''s
Automotive. So, today we''re working with
the Honda Civic, you guys. And this is
like 2016 and up for push to start. Now,
the customer had a auto universal remote
pro into the vehicle.
And the thing is that it was kind of
working. It turns on the car when it
wants to. It doesn''t turn on. Sometimes
it does. So, she''s like, "Hey, I''m just
going to get an OEM smart key and just
go ahead and program it." So, I said,
"All right." So, we''re going to be using
our auto. Go ahead and make sure you
have your uh emergency lights on if you
can''t turn it on. If you can turn it on,
turn it on. Okay. Now, um we''re going to
go to automatic uh VIN scan. So, it''s
going to automatically search for the
vehicle using the VIN. Um like I said,
if you can turn it on, turn it on. We''re
going to select smart key.
We''re going to do a push to start. Okay?
Because it''s push to start.
Um, as you guys can see, there''s
information right there for Civic.
Um, we''re going to We always go through
MMO status scan just because it it does
the the scan of the MMO system and it
lets us know something''s wrong with it
um or anything. So, it says is ignition
turned on by pressing the start button.
If you can turn it on, yes. If you can
press no.
So, um, we''re going to go ahead and scan
it. You guys can see it has the smart
system on here and then the immo system.
So, the smart system would be like
anything that''s keyless, any modules
that are that can pick it up, you know,
the immo system, of course, is the
immobilizer system that immobilizes a
vehicle if it''s not the correct key. So,
um, we''re going to go through all keys
lost. Actually, if you have a key, you
can go through add a key, but I''m going
to go through all keys lost because at
the end of the day, their key didn''t
want to turn on the car and off when it
needed to. And this requires you to turn
on and off the car. So, it says to place
the key to be learned in the vehicle and
take all the other keys out.
Is the ignition turned on by pressing
on? Um, no. We can''t turn it on. So,
we''re going to press no. It says press
and hold the start button. So, we''re
going to press and hold the start button
until the until the ignition uh turns on
and the cluster turns on and all the
lights, everything kind of like
accessory mode.
Um, is ignition switched on? Please
release the ignition. We''re going to
press okay.
Okay, here''s the next step. whether it''s
a newer model generally refers to after
2020. We''re going to press no because
it''s not over 2020. It''s like 16 through
18.
Now it''s establish establishing vehicle
communication.
Okay. Checking condition of the vehicle.
Please wait.
Keep program success. Would you like to
program the next one?
Press yes if you have another one. Press
no if you don''t have another one. So
it''s telling us to press the start
button.
Okay, to turn it off.
Now it says to turn it on. So basically
for all Honda, this is how it is. Turn
it off. Turn it on.
So you might have to um
Okay. Are both the keys
keyless? Is indicator immobilizer light
off? Yes, it''s off. We''re going to press
yes. Now again, it''s going to tell us to
shut it off. So, we''re going to press
it.
Now, it says to turn it on. Okay. Now,
now you''re going to have to press it
twice to turn it on every time you press
it. So, press it twice to turn it off
and once, excuse me, press it twice to
turn it on and once to turn it off. As
you guys can see, the registration is
complete. Okay, turn it off. Press it
once to turn it off. Now, don''t put your
foot on the brake, okay? Like, do not
start the actual vehicle. It just wants
you to put it in accessory mode. As you
guys can see, excuse me, it''s
programmed. The remote works. Everything
works perfectly. Um, please don''t forget

all right i put a new control unit in
here or master switch and now when you
do that not only does it have to be
programmed but the key fob has to be
programmed as you can see
i''m pressing the buttons it''s not doing
anything
so we need to program this key to the
vehicle again
and uh
it''s pretty simple i''ll show you how now
while i''m thinking of it
if this
if your key fob is not programmed to the
car
if i lock the door and open it or unlock
it and open it from inside
and i i''m not using the lock it''s gonna
think that i broke into the car and it''s
probably gonna set off uh it''s gonna set
off the alarm
you know with the horn
and uh you''re not gonna be able to shut
it off until you program the key and
then hit the unlock button just so you
know and you can program it even with
the security code going off you can
program a key i''ve done it before
so anyway all we''re gonna do right now
it''s in the zero position or off we''re
gonna put the key in and we''re gonna
turn it to the number two position or
the on position
and we''re gonna do that and then i''m
just gonna be pressing you can use
either the unlock or the lock i''m gonna
use the lock button and we''re gonna
press that button in a sequence four
times
so we just have to put the key in we''re

When programming a new remote for a modern Toyota, start with the vehicle off, use a working key to turn the ignition on, and keep the new remote in hand ready for programming—this allows you to execute the procedure smoothly without scrambling.

**Walkthrough:**

1. Begin with the vehicle completely off and all doors closed.
2. Insert the original working key into the ignition.
3. Turn the ignition to the "ON" position using that key (do not start the engine).
4. With the new remote in your hand, press and hold the **LOCK** and **UNLOCK** buttons together.
5. Wait for the vehicle to acknowledge the programming attempt—you will hear an audible confirmation (like a chime) or see the lights flash.
6. Once confirmed, turn the ignition off and test both remotes to ensure they operate the locks properly.', highlights = '**Pearl:**

Always perform the lock/unlock cycling using the driver''s side door *switch*, not the remote, to properly enter programming mode without accidentally exiting it.

**Walkthrough:**

1. Ensure the key is out of the ignition, all other doors are closed and unlocked, and the driver''s door is open.

2. Insert the physical key into the ignition without turning it, then remove it.

3. Using the driver''s door power switch, press LOCK and then UNLOCK five complete times.

4. Close and then reopen the driver''s door.

5. Using the same door switch, perform another five cycles of LOCK then UNLOCK.

6. Insert the key into the ignition, turn the ignition ON, then OFF, and remove the key. The door locks will cycle automatically, confirming entry into programming mode.

7. On the first remote, press and hold both the LOCK and UNLOCK buttons simultaneously for one second, then release.

8. Immediately after, press and hold just the LOCK button for approximately two seconds. The door locks will cycle to confirm successful programming.

9. For any additional remotes, repeat steps 7 and 8 for each one, in sequence.

Always verify you are starting with a master key before attempting to program a new key chip by inserting your existing key into the ignition and observing the dashboard security light; a master key will cause the blinking red light to turn off immediately, while a valet key will leave it illuminated for several seconds before it turns off.

**Walkthrough:**

**Step 1: Connect the Programming Device**
1. Locate the OBD2 port, typically under the dashboard near the brake pedal. Plug the programming cable into the port.
2. Screw the programming device (TSL2 model) securely onto the cable. Ensure the Bluetooth light on the device illuminates red.

**Step 2: Pair the Device via Bluetooth**
1. Using the provided phone with the pre-installed app, open the application.
2. Wait for the programmer’s Bluetooth light to turn from red to blue, indicating a successful connection to the phone.

**Step 3: Program the Remote (Keyless Entry)**
1. In the app, navigate to the "Immobilization" menu and select "Remote."
2. Insert your working master key into the ignition and turn it two clicks to the "ON" position (dashboard lights illuminate).
3. If unsure of your vehicle type, start with "Type 1" in the app. If connection fails, try "Type 2."
4. Once connected, select "Program Remote" in the app.
5. Turn the ignition off, then back to the "ON" position again.
6. Open the driver’s door and press "Yes" in the app.
7. Follow the on-screen prompt: Press and hold the lock and unlock buttons on the new remote for one second, then press the lock button. Listen for a confirmation beep. Repeat if necessary until programming is successful.
8. Test the new remote by pressing the lock and unlock buttons to verify operation.

**Step 4: Program the Immobilizer Chip (Key Blade)**
1. Confirm you are using a master key (not a valet key) by inserting it into the ignition and watching the dashboard security light. A master key will extinguish the blinking light immediately; a valet key will cause it to stay on for a few seconds before turning off.
2. In the app, navigate back to the home screen, select "Immobilization," then "Immobilizer."
3. Select the correct chip type for your key (e.g., "Type Three G Chip" for 2010-2021 4Runners).
4. Choose "Add a Key" from the menu (avoid "Engine Reset" options).
5. With the master key in the ignition and turned to the "ON" position, press "Yes" in the app. The security light should now be steadily illuminated.
6. Remove the master key and insert the new, uncut key to be programmed. The security light will begin blinking slowly.
7. Wait approximately 60 seconds while the chip programs. The security light will stop blinking when programming is complete.
8. Remove the key and press "OK" in the app.

**Step 5: Verify Key Chip Programming**
1. Insert the newly programmed key into the ignition. The dashboard security light should turn off immediately, confirming the chip is programmed.

**Step 6: Cut the Key Blade**
1. To make the key operational, have the metal blade cut to match your original key. Use a local locksmith or a key-by-photo cutting service as described.

**Step 7: Return the Equipment**
1. Power off the provided phone completely to conserve its battery.
2. Disconnect the programmer, place all equipment back in the box, and use the included prepaid return label to ship it back. Your deposit will be refunded upon receipt.', highlights = '**Pearl:**

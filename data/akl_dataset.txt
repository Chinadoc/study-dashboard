All Keys Lost Immobilizer Dataset (2000–2025)
Below is a comprehensive CSV-formatted table of North American consumer vehicles (2000–2025) with immobilizer details for All Keys Lost (AKL) scenarios. The dataset is organized by make and model, including year ranges (with separate entries for different generations or trim-level systems where applicable). Each entry lists the relevant control module, its location, the key storage chip (main MCU and any external EEPROM), whether the PIN code can be pulled via OBD, the typical AKL solution, supported tools, and additional notes (e.g. security wait times or special procedures). Duplicate or redundant entries are intentionally kept where the same method applies across model years, to retain clarity for each model/year.
Legend: “PIN via OBD” = whether the vehicle’s PIN code can be obtained through OBD with common locksmith tools (Yes/No). “AKL Method” = recommended approach when all keys are lost (e.g. remove module to read EEPROM, OBD programming with emulator, etc.).
General Motors (Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC)
Model years around the mid-2000s saw GM transition from VATS/Passlock (no transponder) to transponder-based Passkey III systems. Older GM models often require a 10-30 minute learn procedure (no PIN). Newer models store key data in BCM or dedicated anti-theft module. In AKL cases, reading the BCM EEPROM or MCU can retrieve key data or security code if standard OBD programming isn’t available.

Ford (Ford & Lincoln)
Ford’s PATS (Passive Anti-Theft System) uses transponder keys since late 1990s. There is usually no static PIN; instead Ford uses timed access or an incode/outcode challenge for key programming. All-keys-lost typically requires either: waiting out a security timer (e.g. 10–16 minute countdown) or using a locksmith tool to calculate an incode from the vehicle’s outcode. Earlier Fords store immobilizer data in a standalone PATS module or the ECU/cluster (with EEPROM), while later models integrate it into the instrument cluster or BCM.

Toyota (Toyota & Lexus)
Toyota’s immobilizer systems range from older Denso immoboxes (with 8-pin EEPROMs) to modern smart key modules. Most Toyota/Lexus do not use a simple PIN; instead they require either a seed reset or reading an EEPROM when all keys are lost. Earlier (1998–early 2000s) models with 4C/4D transponders often store key data in a small EEPROM (e.g. 93C56 or 93C66) on an immobox or ECU. All-keys-lost on those requires reading the EEPROM dump and either resetting it or using it to program a new key[11][15]. Mid-2000s “G” chip systems can sometimes be reset via OBD (16-minute wait or seed calculation) but often easier by EEPROM as well[16]. Smart Key systems (push-button start) have an ID Code Box and a Smart ECU – locksmith tools use either an emulator (to simulate a valid key via OBD) or require removal of one of the modules to reset. Time-lockouts (e.g. 16-minute wait) apply for some add-key or reset procedures.

Honda / Acura
Honda uses an immobilizer unit typically mounted on the ignition switch (for key models) or an integrated keyless access controller (for push-start). Older Hondas (through mid-2000s) store keys in a small EEPROM (93C46/24C04) on the immobilizer control unit, which can be read to recover the key info or reset the unit[20]. Newer Hondas (approximately 2008+) often encrypt immobilizer data in the MICU/ECM and require HDS (Honda Diagnostic System) or locksmith tools to program. Honda does not use user PIN codes; instead, all-keys-lost key programming is done via the factory tool (online code) or by EEPROM methods.

Nissan / Infiniti
Nissan vehicles use an immobilizer known as NATS. Older Nissans (early 2000s and prior) often have a dedicated immobox (e.g. around the ignition barrel) with an EEPROM like 93C66 or 24C02 that stores the keys and PIN. Newer models integrate immobilizer functions into the BCM. Nissan uses PIN codes for programming: early systems use a 4-digit PIN, mid-2000s use a 12-digit PIN, and 2013+ use a 20-digit rolling code. Many locksmith tools can calculate the PIN from the BCM or by reading an EEPROM dump. In all-keys-lost, typically one either retrieves the PIN (via OBD or from a dump) then programs via OBD, or in some cases directly writes a key into the EEPROM dump for older models.

Hyundai / Kia
Hyundai/Kia use PIN codes for key programming. Older models (pre-2007) use a fixed 4-digit PIN (often printed on a card or retrievable by VIN). Around 2007–2010, they moved to a rolling 6-digit PIN (which can be calculated from the vehicle VIN or an algorithm). After ~2016, many models switched to an 20-digit challenge code (dealer online needed). Immobilizer data on early 2000s models is often in a small EEPROM (93C56, 95040, etc.) inside an immobox near the ignition. Newer models integrate it into the SMARTRA module or BCM. All keys lost can often be solved by obtaining/calculating the PIN and using an OBD tool to program new keys. In some cases (especially older ones), reading the EEPROM can allow manual key creation or PIN extraction.

Chrysler / Dodge / Jeep / RAM (FCA)
Chrysler vehicles use a PIN (originally 4-digit, later 5-digit after ~2005) for key programming. Older models (late ’90s to early 2000s) used a Sentry Key Immobilizer Module (SKIM or SKIS) – a small black module near the steering column with an EEPROM that stores keys and PIN[32]. Mid-2000s to 2010s models moved to integrated WCM/WIN modules (wireless control module, often in the ignition switch for FOBIK keys) or the RF Hub in push-to-start vehicles. All Keys Lost solutions often involve either pulling the PIN code (via OBD or by reading the EEPROM from the immobilizer module) and then programming new keys with a scan tool. In some cases (like certain Jeeps), reading an EEPROM or MCU from the module is needed if the PIN cannot be obtained via OBD. Chrysler’s newer systems have increasing security (e.g. SGW after 2018 requiring a bypass).

Subaru
Subaru began using transponder systems in the mid-2000s. Earlier models (before ~2005 in North America) typically did not have immobilizers, except some high-end trims. Models like Legacy/Outback (2005+) and Impreza/Forester (2006+) introduced immobilizers. Subaru uses a 8-digit or 12-digit PIN code for programming, which the dealer can obtain via their diagnostic tool (Subaru Select Monitor) – this is not easily available to independent locksmiths without a tool. In practice, all-keys-lost on many Subarus is resolved by cloning or swapping the EEPROM that stores the key info (often located in the ECM or BIU). For example, many 2005–2010 Subarus store immobilizer data on a 93LC56 (L56R) EEPROM inside the ECU[23]. Newer push-to-start models (with smart keys) use a combination of a Keyless Access Module and an Steering Lock ECU that are usually dealer-handled for AKL (some aftermarket tools are just beginning to support them via EEPROM/MCU reading).

Mazda
Mazda’s immobilizer systems often mirror Ford’s PATS (for earlier models co-developed with Ford) and later use their own modules. Pre-2005 Mazdas (MPV, early Tribute, etc.) used standalone immoboxes. The Mazda3/6 (2004–2013) used Ford PATS integrated in the instrument cluster, requiring incode/outcode like Ford[39]. Newer Mazdas with push-button start (2014+ “Skyactiv” models) use a BCM/remote unit storing keys; these require a dealer-like approach (online code via Mazda IDS or aftermarket calculation of a backup code). There is typically no static PIN; key programming uses challenge-response or timed access, except for some older Japanese-import models. All-keys-lost on modern Mazdas often requires either obtaining an incode (via Mazda’s server or a third-party) or, for some models, reading the ECU/BCM data for manual programming.

Volkswagen / Audi
VW/Audi vehicles employ evolving immobilizer generations (IMMO2, IMMO3, IMMO4, IMMO5). Older models (1999–2004) use immobilizer data stored in the instrument cluster or a separate box, often with an EEPROM (e.g. 93C86) that can be read to get the 4-digit PIN[43][44]. 2005–2014 (Immo4) introduced component security: keys are matched via 7-byte CS and a PIN, stored in cluster (often a Micronas MCU + 24C32/24C64 EEPROM) or in a separate Kessy/BCM module for keyless models[45][46]. All-keys-lost on Immo4 usually requires reading the EEPROM + MCU of the cluster or BCM to extract the key data/CS. 2015+ MQB/Immo5 systems (Golf 7, Audi B9, etc.) are much more secure; some require online connection to program new keys, while advanced tools use external readers to read locked MCU data or synchronize ECUs. PIN via OBD is generally only applicable to the pre-2005 models (which used a visible PIN code).

BMW / Mini
BMW utilized EWS modules in older models (approx 1995–2005) and moved to CAS (Car Access System) modules for 2005 onward, and then FEM/BDC for the newest models. EWS (1-4) modules are separate immobilizer units with Motorola MCUs (HC11/HC12) that store key info – all keys lost requires reading the EWS MCU (via programmer or in-circuit) to either extract key data or sync a new key[56]. CAS (CAS2, CAS3, CAS3+, CAS4) modules store keys in internal EEPROM (usually MC9S12 processors). All keys lost often requires removing the CAS and reading it with a programmer to retrieve ISN and key data, or using a specialized tool to obtain the ISN from the DME and then program a key. Newer CAS3+ are encrypted, but tools can still handle via dump or OBD (with downgrade). FEM/BDC (2014+) store keys and require specialized procedures (like using BMW dealer ISN or unlocking the module with special hardware). All-keys-lost on FEM/BDC typically involves reading the engine ECU ISN and then programming keys via OBD with a capable tool (e.g. Autel, AutoHex) or in some cases, bench unlocking of the FEM.

Mercedes-Benz
Mercedes uses Electronic Ignition Switch (EIS) modules that are highly secure. Most models store key data in the EIS (sometimes also referred to as EZS). The keys are infrared “smart keys” (older ones use Motorola “Big Key” or NEC “Chrome” key). All-keys-lost on Mercedes generally involves reading the EIS’s MCU (either via IR port, onboard diagnostics with special hardware, or by desoldering the chip) to extract the key hash data, then using a key programming tool to calculate the new key. Classic EIS (1997–2005) uses Motorola MCU (HC05/HC08) which can be read with programmers[57]. Newer EIS (after ~2005, DAS3) use encrypted NEC chips and require a “password” calculation, which tools like Autel G-Box or Mercedes IR programmers do by brute-force or cloud. Very new models (FBS4, ~2015+) cannot be done by aftermarket for AKL at time of writing (only dealer can add keys).

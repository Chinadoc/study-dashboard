gather all key fobs you intend to
program, including any that currently
work. Make sure your car battery is
fully charged to avoid interruptions.
This process involves a specific
sequence of steps that must be followed
carefully. We''ll walk through each part
to ensure your new or replacement key
fob functions correctly. It''s a
straightforward process once you
understand the timing. To begin, sit in
the driver''s seat and ensure all doors
are securely closed. Insert your key
into the ignition and turn it to the on
position, but do not start the engine.
Within 4 seconds of turning the key,
press the lock button on one of the key
fobs you wish to program. This action
helps initiate the vehicle''s programming
mode. You''ll hear a distinct click or
sound confirming entry. Now, turn the
key to the off position, then
immediately back to on within 4 seconds.
Again, press the lock button on the same
key fob within 4 seconds. You need to
repeat this entire on, off, on, lock
sequence two more times. The car''s door
locks will cycle, indicating successful
entry into the programming phase. This
confirms the vehicle is ready to learn
the key fob signal. Once the locks
cycle, press the lock button on every
key fob you want to program, including
any existing ones, within 10 seconds.
The locks will cycle again after each
successful registration. After
programming all fobs, turn the ignition
key to the off position to exit the
programming mode. Test each key fob to
ensure all functions like lock and
unlock work correctly. Remember to check
the description for a link to the OALA
water bottle and other great deals.

so uh i will pause the video and uh
we''ll come back again
okay guys we cut the keys and uh
let''s turn the card off and the new keys
is not programmed yet

                             VALUES ('nKenS2gO9ZM', 'hey it''s Alex here and welcome to this
video on transponder key programming so
what I''m going to do is give you a quick
overview about what we''re going to learn
in this lesson and then at the end of
this lesson you''re also going to see a
live demonstration of me programming a
car key so let''s get into it so what
we''re going to cover are what are
transponder Keys how a mobilizer systems
work and the process of cloning and
programming transponder key
so let''s get into it so what are
transponder keys so in basic terms a
transponder key is a car key that
contains a small microchip inside that
microchip communicates with the car''s
immobilizer system and allows the engine
to start so here''s how that works when
the key is IGN inserted into the
ignition that chip in the in the key the
micr chip the transponder sends a signal
to the ECU usually an RD signal radio
signal if that code matches the car
starts now if the code doesn''t match the
car won''t start so even if the key
physically fits even if it turns the
lock it will not start the car now
obviously this is this was invented to
prevent people stealing cars that''s the
main use of this so that''s just
something simple to understand at this
stage um so for an example a 2005 Ford
Focus uses a transponder key while a
1995 Toyota Corolla does not so with the
Toyota Corolla you''d be able to actually
cut a key to it um if you had the
original key you could simply duplicate
that key turn the ignition and drive
away whereas with a 2005 Ford Focus even
if you cut the key to it correctly it
wouldn''t start the engine you would need
this transponder in the key to make it
start so the different types of
transponders are fixed code transponders
so these us a single code for all keys
rolling Co code or often called crypto
uh transponders generate a new code
every time the key is used so this is
obviously an extra layer of security so
literally every time the the key is used
it will write itself a new code and then
you''ve got a encrypted trans trans
bonders which are more advanced and
harder to clone so some common Brands so
Ford Toyota and Honda use these rolling
code crypto transponders BMW and
Mercedes for example use the high
security encrypted
transponders now a quick tip is the type
of transponder key determines whether it
can be cloned or programmed into the ECU
so you might have circumstances where a
customer might come to you you ask for a
duplicate key it''s not as
straightforward just to uh duplicate
that key you would need to program a new
key into the vehicle and then program
the existing key as well so you just got
to keep that in mind it really depends
on the make and model so how do these
immobilizer systems work then so what is
an immobilizer so it''s an anti- theft
system that prevents the car from
starting without the program key it
works by verifying the chip signal from
the key before allowing ignition and the
key components of this are the
transponder key itself so this is the
physical key with the transponder inside
the chip inside the antenna ring so this
is the often known as the reader coil
this is what goes around the uh actual
ignition
itself and that reads the signal from
the key and then you''ve got the ECU
which is essentially like the the car''s
brain so this is where it stores
programmed key codes and many other
things for the vehicle um so that''s like
the if you think of that as like the
brain to the vehicle so here''s an
example so if a thief cuts a new metal
key for a car but doesn''t have it
programmed um with the transponder the
immobilizer will prevent the engine from
starting now if you did program the
correct transponder to the vehicle
you could then start the car so how to
use a key programmer to to clone keys so
what is key cloning so key cloning is
copying the transponder chip data onto a
blank
transponder so any simple example a
customer comes to you with a working key
you''re able to read that that chips data
using your machine and then transfer
that data onto a blank chip onto a new
chip so this works best for fix code
transponders so the steps to that don''t
worry I''m going to get into a visual
demonstration of this but just to give
you an outline you would insert the
original key into the programmer read
and copy the chip data then insert the
new blank transponder key write the copy
data onto that new key and test to make
sure the key
starts now common Key Programs for we
have covered that in another lesson so
if you haven''t got the full course for
this uh there''s a link in the
description where you can get this
entire course for free um so that would
be an ex xhorse an utel or smart key
programmer and one thing to keep in mind
is not all transponders can be cloned
now some require ECU programming instead
um so another thing to to keep in mind
here is um when it comes to these fixed
codes transponders you you might think
that your business if you''re just
starting in this business now you might
think that the common house uh the
common High Street Key Cutters are
competing with you because well can''t
they just copy any key and uh go ahead
well the truth is they can''t because the
when it comes to these crypto
transponders with the rolling data
they''re not going to be able to do most
of them because they''re going to need to
actually physically leave their shop and
pro um plug the machine the the key
programmer into the vehicle and do it
that way they'' need to program a key
from scratch and not many High Street
shops offer that also if the customers
lost all the keys to their vehicle most
of these High Street Key Cutters don''t
physically have the staff or the
capability of leaving the shop going out
on site picking and decoding in the car
uh cutting the key and so on so you need
to think that you''re not in danger by
these key cutting shops and often they
will call you if you go around some of
these key cutting shops hand them your
business card they will actually send
you plenty of work uh which they can''t
dosel so let''s talk about adding keys so
this is instead of cloning uh this will
be when a new key is registered directly
into the ECU so this is is required for
Rolling code and encrypted transponders
and often when an original key isn''t
present so the steps of doing this is
you would connect your key programmer to
the car''s o OBD Port now we''re going to
get into this in
another shortly you''re going to get a
visual demonstration of this but the obb
port is essentially just a socket in the
car that''s usually hidden in the
footwell area where you plug your key
programming machine into and that would
allow you to talk directly to the ECU um
rather than using radio signals so you
would select the cars make model and
year you would enter the pin or security
code if required it''s not always
required then you would insert the new
key with obviously the correct
transponder in and follow the onscreen
programming steps and then you would
obviously test the key to make sure it
starts so as you can see this is really
just pushing buttons so if you can
operate an iPhone or you know a simple
laptop you can do this because it''s
really we''re not talking about any Dex
dextrous skill here there''s no uh you
don''t need to train for years to be able
to to learn how to just follow the
onscreen programming steps you just need
to be able to know um obviously the
correct parts to use and then to be able
to follow follow these instructions that
the machine''s going to give you so some
common key programmers are an utel smart
Pro and the key tool plus um and an
example might be a 2012 Honda Accord
requires ECU programming while a 2004
Fiesta can be cloned so let''s say a
customer comes to you with a 2012 Honda
Accord um and you''ll you can''t just
simply duplicate their key um whereas
with a for 2000 uh Ford Fiesta you''ll be
able to just simply clone the key uh
clone the
transponder so here''s some issues and
solutions so what happens if a car won''t
start after programming usually you need
to check if the ecu''s accepted the key
ensure that the key is correctly uh
coded verify that the transponder chip
is compatible so one of the main
mistakes people make is is trying to try
trying to program the wrong chip to the
vehicle so you need to make sure uh you
can double check to make sure you''re
using the correct transponder now the
key programmer can''t communicate with
the ECU so you need to check if your if
this car requires a security pin code
now most of the time your key programmer
will be able to read the PIN code the
security pin code for the vehicle or the
customer customer will actually have
this pin code without even knowing it so
usually it''s actually in the car in the
glove box in their uh log book for the
vehicle you can often find the PIN code
in there and you can also call the
dealership where the cars purchased from
and retrieve the PIN code from there but
usually your key programming machine
will actually read the PIN code itself
uh so make sure you''re you''re putting in
the correct PIN code make sure the OBD
sockets working and make sure you also
have a a battery tester plugged in as
well battery booster because that will
also um improve the communication
between the key programmer and the
ECU so what happens if your duplicate
key doesn''t work after you''ve programmed
it sometimes it might say that it''s
programmed successfully but it still
doesn''t work now just obviously ensure
the chip was cloned correctly by going
through the procedure again or you can
try manually adding that key to the ECU
rather than cloning it okay so you might
try and clone a key it doesn''t work you
can then try and add it manually so a
good tip is to always have multiple key
programming tools uh to make sure you''ve
got good coverage but don''t start off
like that purchase the most basic key
programmer you can find and get your
feet wet first get confident using it
and then eventually when the market
demands it you''ll know when the right
time to purchase more equipment so now I
invite you to watch a key cutting
demonstration so what I want you to do
when you watch this um in this
demonstration is to observe how the
original key is read so we''re going to
talk about a key dup uh key duplication
here identify the programming process so
how straightforward it is just push in
the buttons and take notes on the steps
and tool used so your goal for this
lesson really is to understand the full
process before attempting key
programming on an actual vehicle so
let''s check the video out and you''re
just going to select the
vehicle the make is a
Ford which is
European and the model is a
Transit go to Transit and we know it''s
the
2012 so we go between 2007 to
2013 select that we know it''s bladed now
it''s just going to literally tell us
what to do switch ignition on and press
enter now you want to be looking at the
dash lights in this moment the moment
you can see we got a red flashing light
there so back to this press enter
this is just going to find the vehicle
so it''s found it press
enter and now special
functions you can see the radio''s come
on
already and we want to go to add key
little says one token will be used
that''s fine is this you is this
something to do with you now it''s just
doing its
thing Keys program free now it''s saying
press back to exit or end to program
next key that''s it and back to exit
procedure complete press
enter now if we look at the dash
now we''ll see that it''s flashing
slowly okay so if we just turn that
off we''ll turn off the
ignition always unplug the ODB before
you test it that''s just a little thing I
like to do I don''t know if makes a
difference but I prefer to do that um if
we turn the ignition on now you see the
red light comes on but it''s gone off so
that''s a good sign if we just turn the
ignition now make sure it''s out of
gear there we go we have lift off give
it a few revs to charge the
battery and there we go okay so I hope
you enjoyed that demonstration there so
here''s a quick summary of this lesson so
transponder keys are used uh as
chip-based security to prevent theft
immobilized systems require a part
programmed key to start the engine key
cloning works for fixed code
transponders when an original keys
present while rolling codes require ECU
programming using key programmers
locksmith can add the Del and reprogram
keys so what I want you to do if you

hey guys what''s up Derek with Advanced
love Automotive welcome back to the
channel welcome back to another video
now as promised before on my channel I
did tell you guys that I was gonna start
doing some videos getting more into the
locksmithing and key programming side of
the industry I''ve recently discovered a
passion with this side of the industry
I''ve been doing it now for almost a year
and I want to show you guys some of the
things that I''ve learned so maybe I can
help some of you guys that are
interested in getting into this field
not one of the most common questions
that I see asked over and over again by
aspiring locksmiths is what equipment
should I buy what is the best key
programmer where should I start so in
this series of videos I''m going to try
and help you guys decide what key
programmer slash key tool is best for
you now I will preface this video by
saying there is not one key programmer
that does everything so if you guys are
looking for that magic bullet that one
key programmer that just does everything
well I got bad news for you guys it
doesn''t exist in this industry you''re
going to find out that you pretty much
are required to buy many different
programmers in order to cover as many
vehicles as possible but what I hope to
do with this video is give you guys a
starting point show you guys the tool
that I use for almost 90 percent of the
vehicles that I program keys for so over
here in my toolbox as you guys can see
I''ve got all of my most commonly used
key programmers and key tools starting
over here on the left I have the X tool
ik618 over here I''ve got the autel im508
over here to the right we''ve got the
launch x431 emo plus over here I''ve got
the xhorse key tool Max here I''ve got
the key DIY kdx2 and I have my xhorse
mini key tool however the one I want to
show you guys in this video is this
little bad boy right here this is the
autel km100 now unlike the im508 the
km100 was designed to be more of a
portable handheld key tool but let me
make this clear the autel cam 100 is not
a complete substitute for the im508 if
you guys are looking to do more eprom
work and keys for European cars the
im508 coupled with the XP P400 is
probably going to be your choice however
for the majority of cars here in North
America the km100 is going to be able to
do a majority of the vehicles on the
road plus it has some built-in features
that does not come with the im508 and
they have to be purchased as an extra
add-on so with that being said let''s
delve a little bit deeper into this game
100 and find out what it''s capable of
now before we dig deeper into this tool
I do want to take a quick moment to show
you guys everything that comes in the
kit when you buy it so first of all we
have the unit itself which is roughly
about the size of my iPhone and so it''s
a very portable unit and it''s also about
half the price of the iPhone over here
we have the Bluetooth wireless dongle
that also has a built-in light so if you
push this button it''s got a little
flashlight in there to help you find the
OBD2 port you also get this cable which
is USBC to USBC in order for you to
connect the dongle to the unit in some
applications it will advise you to
connect it using the wire there are some
vehicles that you don''t want to program
wirelessly so always make sure to have
this cable at the ready over here as you
can see they give you a charging cable
and a charging block the kit also comes
with two Universal IQ these are
universal Smart keys that can be
generated to many different applications
they also come in various button
configurations we''re going to get a
little bit deeper into these later on in
the video over here we have the cable
that''s used to do remote renews which
basically allows us to unlock previously
locked keys some smart keys on some
Vehicles will become locked whenever
they''re programmed to a car and so
before you can reuse it and program it
to another vehicle you may have to
unlock it that''s what this cable is for
now this really only applies to OEM keys
not really aftermarket Keys which by the
way if you guys are going to be using
the universal eye keys there really is
no need to unlock the keys these can be
regenerated over and over again as many
times as you like so even if you program
this to a car and then something happens
maybe the customer doesn''t want this key
so you want to be able to reuse it on a
different vehicle you can absolutely do
that all you have to do is regenerate
the key using the tool so now we know
everything that comes in the kit let''s
go ahead and dig deeper into the unit
all right guys so here''s the main menu
as you can see we have quite a few
different functions so starting up here
at the top you can see we have our
Universal key that is to generate our
Universal eye Keys now I will get a
little bit deeper into these because
these Universal eye keys are actually
really awesome and they can save you a
ton of money especially when it comes to
having to inventory keys but we''ll get
into that a little bit later in the
video next up you can see we have
reading and cloning which is basically a
function that allows you to read the
chip inside of the key and also clone it
over here we have a transponder function
which we can use to generate
transponders over here we have a
frequency detection where we can test
our remotes down here we have the emo
function which is the immobilizer
function that''s what we''re going to use
in order to program the keys then we
have some more special functions down
here we''ll get into that in a minute let
me start off by selecting reading and
cloning so basically let''s go in here
and we''re going to read a key it''s
instructing us to put either a chip into
the chip hole right here or put your key
into this hole so right now I have this
key for a Chevy Cruze let''s go ahead and
stick it into the slot right here and
then we''re going to hit read it''s
reading the transponder inside the key
and here we can see all the information
about this key up here you can see we
have a chip model we have an emo type
it''s telling us it''s a high Tag 2 id46
it''s giving us a transponder ID the lock
status which basically tells you whether
or not the key is locked this key is
programmed to a vehicle so right now if
you wanted to try to reuse this key on
another vehicle you would first have to
unlock it which means you''d have to open
it up take the circuit board out use a
special function in the key tool along
with this cable like I mentioned before
unlock the chip then you can reprogram
it to another vehicle now as far as
cloning the chip in this key basically
you drop this in there and we''re going
to hit clone now this is a transponder
46 so whenever you clone these Keys it
does require that you do a password
calculation so what the tool instructs
you to do is put the antenna of this
tool up against the ignition coil I''m
referring to the antenna around the
keyhole where you stick the key in it''s
going to detect the coil around the
ignition then it''s going to calculate
the password and allow you to write it
to a clone chip now here''s where it''s
asking you to put the tool up against
the ignition coil you can see that''s the
key going into the keyhole and
essentially every time you insert the
key and turn the key on there''s a signal
that''s being passed back and forth
between the Chip And also the antenna
the autel is going to pick that signal
up it''s going to calculate the password
then it''s going to allow you to clone it
to a chip so we''ve got the key tool
pressed up against the ignition coil I''m
going to go ahead and stick the key in
turn the ignition on
and we may have to do this a few times
so key off take the key out put the key
back in turn it on
do it again
basically just do this until it tells
you whether or not it acquired the
signal
there we have it it is now calculating
as you can see it calculated our
password so that was just a brief
overview of the cloning function of this
tool next up I wanted to show you guys
the transponder function so if we click
on that you can see up here at the top
we have transponder generation so this
is where you would generate a
transponder so if you go down here let''s
say a Ford 4d63 if you wanted to
generate one of these chips of course
you would have to buy whatever chip
works with this tool so if we back out
this second option here is pretty cool
this is a transponder simulation and so
basically what this allows you to do is
use the tool to simulate a key chip now
moving back to the home page let''s go
ahead and click on frequency detection
this is something very useful especially
if you have a remote that''s not working
and you''re not sure if the problem is
with the remote or with the vehicle you
can just use this function to test the
frequency of the remote so I''m going to
go ahead and unlock this you guys can
see how it just registered the frequency
and it tells us what frequency the key
is so I''m going to click it again
you guys can see this remote is 315
megahertz now we''re going to go into
special functions and here''s where
you''re going to find a lot of cool
different things that you can do first
of all you can do key unlocking again if
you guys have a key an OEM key that was
previously locked to another vehicle you
can use this tool to renew that key so
here we''re in the Dodge menu let''s just
pick any of these you can see they give
you a little diagram right here of how
to connect to the circuit board using
the supplied cable you basically have to
solder to the points on the board then
you hit unlock and it will unlock the
key now another function that you can
use this for is unlocking Toyota Smart
keys this function is very easy to do
you don''t have to open the key there''s
no soldering involved you basically just
stick the key into the slot up here hit
unlock and it will unlock the key now
let me warn you guys Toyota Keys
starting from 2018 2019 and up a lot of
those keys cannot be unlocked I know
this personally because I ran into one
on a 2020 where I use the key tool to
unlock the key and even when I use the
key tool to read the key again it showed
that it was unlocked however it would
not program back into the vehicle on
those newer Toyotas once the keys are
locked they''re locked for good another
function that you can do here is you can
do button adjustment which basically
means that if you generate a universal I
key and program it to the vehicle and
for whatever reason the button
Arrangement is not correct let''s say
when you push the lock button the doors
unlock and when you push the unlock
button the doors lock and you need to
switch those button Arrangements all you
got to do is take the key Stick it into
the slot select the button adjustment
and you can switch them around however
you like okay so I have another
Universal I key that has a battery in it
and so we''re going to slide it in here
we''ll hit retry it''s detecting the
universal remote and here we have our
button functions again you can see that
the unlock icon is unlocked the lock
icon is lock remote start is remote
start the trunk button is the trunk and
the Panic is the Panic so again you can
go in here and you can move them around
so let''s say that you wanted to move the
unlock button and make it the lock you
could just select lock and then you want
it to make the lock button the unlock
button you can go in there and select
unlock and now all you have to do is
confirm writing and this will write that
button adjustment into the key you can
see it''s writing it right now and now
you can see that the unlock icon is now
the lock button and the lock icon is now
the unlock button you can also do
combination buttons where if there''s
another function let''s say like a
convertible top and your key doesn''t
have that button you could do a
combination where in this case if you
push the remote start and the trunk
button at the same time you can make it
work for let''s say a convertible top
lots of really cool stuff that you can
do with these Universal eye keys and
just as easy as it was to change the
button configurations you can just as
easily restore the initial value by just
clicking here and it restores everything
back to the way it was now another cool
special function that you can use is
this ignition coil detection this is
useful when you have a vehicle that''s a
no start and you''re not sure whether the
problem is in the key or the antenna
coil on the vehicle so if we select
ignition coil detection all you got to
do is take the antenna on top of the
tool right here put it up against the
antenna on the vehicle put the key in
turn it and see whether not you''re
getting a signal very useful to have
some other special functions that you
have are these Mazda id49 smart key
warning lamp clearings basically on some
Mazdas when you program a key to them if
the key is not the exact or correct FCC
ID or the correct button Arrangement or
sometimes if it''s an aftermarket key the
vehicle may still start and run with the
key but you''re going to get a light on
the dash this function is used to help
you get rid of that light there''s also a
function for the Nissan Infiniti and
there''s another Universal key bot
adjustment I''m not exactly sure what
that does guys but if you need it it''s
there now moving into the immobilizer
side I''m not going to go too much into
detail right now because I am going to
be showing you how to program a key on a
Nissan later on in this video but
basically when you come in here you can
see that you have all different
manufacturers that you can program keys
for everything from domestic import
Europeans the list goes on and on if you
guys are not sure about compatibility
you can go on to the autel website and
they do have a compatibility chart where
you can go in there put the tool that
you''re working with the make and model
and see what you can and cannot do with
it we also have a selection here for
automatically identifying the VIN now I
will mention that the tool works best as
long as you''re connected to the internet
so wherever you''re going to program Keys
make sure you take a Wi-Fi hotspot with
you a lot of times I just use my phone
as a hotspot and that usually works good
enough so now that we''ve covered
everything else let me take you guys
into the big reason that I love this
tool and that is the universal key
generation function basically what this
allows us to do is it allows us to
generate over 700 plus FCC IDs for all
different makes and models of course
this function only works with the autel
universal eye keys but the selection of
I Keys is really awesome I''m going to
show you guys here in a little bit my
inventory of autel keys these here are
just the basic design but they do have
these keys in OEM form that look just
like the OEM keys but before we get into
that let''s go ahead and click on the
function here for Universal key now
here''s where we can find the key that
we''re looking for you can do this a
couple different ways you can put in the
VIN number you can put in the license
plate number or you can just come in
here and put your make and model so
let''s go ahead and select a Chevrolet
we''ll choose a model let''s say a
Trailblazer and we''ll choose a year
2020. you can see the reference FCC ID
number is a
hyq4ea that''s what the key originally
looks like now autel does have a
universal key that looks pretty similar
to this one it''s not the exact same one
it''s the one for the Cadillac but I''ve
had a lot of luck selling the Cadillac
style to people who have this type of
key but even if you don''t have that key
you can always use just one of these
Universal keys so let''s go ahead and
generate it I''m going to select it it
tells us to go ahead and put the
universal key in the slot now of course
you want to make sure that you put a
battery in your key these keys do not
come with batteries so you do have to
buy them now we''re going to go ahead and
select generate Universal key
it''s acquiring the universal key
information and now it''s generating our
key
okay so our Universal key is generated
that probably took about a minute or so
so here when you''re done you want to
just go ahead and hit completed and now
our Universal I key has been generated
it is now ready to be programmed to the
vehicle like any other FCC ID with
hyq4ea it is that simple guys like I
said the cool thing about these Keys is
that they are reusable you can generate
them as many times as you like so if I
want to back out of this menu and
generate this key to another FCC ID I
can do it no problem even if I program
this key to a vehicle and it becomes
locked to that vehicle let''s say there''s
a problem with the customer maybe the
payment didn''t go through you already
programmed the key and so you want to
take your key back it''s no problem all
you got to do is stick it back in here
and regenerate it and the key will be as
good as new and ready to use on another
vehicle that''s something you cannot do
with OEM keys or even aftermarket Keys
okay guys so just a quick overview of
some of the keys that autel offers in
their Universal format these are some
keys from my personal inventory like I
said I stock all different kinds of keys
for lots of different makes them models
but what I love about these Keys is that
they do offer them in the OEM shell so
here we have one that''s a Nissan style
key now I do have this in the four
button configuration without the remote
start and also the three button
configuration I''m not going to open up
all my keys to show you guys but
basically this here is a universal Smart
Key and can be generated to work with
over 700 different Vehicles using an
autel device like this one now
technically you can generate these
Universal Keys using the im508 however
what I like about the km100 is that it''s
way more portable it''s a lot easier to
use you don''t have to pull out the
separate attachment which is the XP 200
pull the cable out connect it to the
unit in order to generate your Universal
key you can simply just pull out this
unit Slide the key in here of course put
a battery in it first select your
Universal key and then generate it now
the reason I love these keys so much is
that when it comes to inventory and keys
for example let''s say Nissan you might
look at a key for a Nissan Altima and a
Nissan Maxima and the key looks exactly
the same however the FCC IDs of the keys
and the part numbers are actually
different meaning that you couldn''t use
a key from a Nissan Pathfinder on a
Nissan Altima typically they''re going to
be different FCC IDs so rather than
having to inventory one of every FCC ID
that there is for Nissan you can simply
have one key and be able to generate
that key to work with whatever vehicle
you''re programming the key for all you
got to do is look up what fccid is the
correct one for the vehicle I usually do
this by going online and looking through
the catalogs usually uhshardware.com is
a pretty reliable and accurate source
for looking up what type of key your
vehicle needs find the correct FCC ID
for your make and model then find that
FCC ID in the autel generate your key to
that and then program it to the vehicle
that will save you tons of money in
inventory now not only do we have the
Nissan style we also have this Hyundai
style of course these keys do come with
the emergency blade so make sure that
whatever you''re using it for uses the
same emergency blade here we have the
Dodge style this is the five button
configuration I also have the four
button configuration now the other cool
thing about these Keys is that even if
you don''t have the correct button
configuration you can buy the correct
shell for the key that you''re looking
for take the internals out of this key
and move it over to your new shell here
we have the GM style key which is the
Cadillac stock very high quality key
very beautiful indeed a lot of people
have no problem taking this key rather
than some of the older Cadillac keys I
like to sell these as upgrades because
typically those older Cadillac keys they
start to fall apart really easily and
these keys well they''re just better made
then over here we have the Honda style
key this is one of the ones that I sell
more often again people like the style
key and so even for some of the older
style Hondas when I offer them this
newer style they prefer to take this one
again the cool thing about these Keys is
that yes you can change the shell in one
instance I had a customer with a 2021
Acura and they prefer to have the Acura
style key and so basically I generated
and programmed one of these keys and
then I took the internals out of the key
and then I put it into an Acura shell
just to show you guys this is the shell
for the Acura key so there is nothing
inside this key but essentially what you
can do is take the guts out of this key
and it fits right into this key these
shells can be purchased really cheaply
online and are good to have whenever you
have a customer that is a little more
picky and they want the key that looks
like their original key just a quick tip
for you guys also I will add that the
auto Universal I key for the three
button Nissan only comes in this button
configuration which I''m not exactly sure
why because I''ve never seen a Nissan
that has this button Arrangement
typically if it''s a three button this
button down here is going to be a panic
button a lot of the vehicles like the
Nissan Rogues and the Jukes don''t have
an electronic trunk so it''s typically
just a panic button here however it''s no
big deal I still like to buy these
because all I do is I buy the shell for
the three button key that I need all I
got to do is take the internals out of
this key and move it over into the shell
now over here we have the BMW fem style
key which is a very beautiful high
quality key and it is required in order
to generate some of these BMW keys Oops
I did leave out one key which is this
Buick style key this is also a universal
eye key so this can be be generated from
many different Vehicles here at the top
you can see I have a few of these
Universal eye Keys these are the generic
styles that autel offers they do come in
a lot of different button configurations
and I pretty much inventory all of them
now I''m not going to go through and open
every single package to show you guys
you can go online and look at all the
different button configurations that
they offer but just know that these keys
do not come with an emergency blade so
when I pop this open what you''re going
to find is that we have a slot right
here and also a little set screw right
there and what these are designed for is
for you to be able to use Flip Key
blades as emergency blades now I''m going
to be getting a little more into detail
when it comes to flip keys and Flip Key
blades in another video but just know
that yes you can put emergency blades
into these Keys now one key that I am
kind of leaving out is this Ford key
right here this is a very special key
the reason I say that is because this
key is the only key out of all of the
autel keys that you can generate it to
the 900 megahertz frequency now contrary
to some of the things you might read
about these keys and them being able to
work for 900 megahertz it is not true
you cannot generate the 902 megahertz
key for the Ford with any of these other
Universal Keys you have to have this key
now the problem with that is that this
key is kind of elusive I can''t really
find it locally or really anywhere in
the US when I check with my key
suppliers they never seem to have these
available however you can buy these
online from places like AliExpress these
in particular I did get while I was on a
trip to Mexico I was in Mexico City for
the auto mechanical event and one of the
vendors there sold these to me but like
I said guys if you run into the Fords
especially the ones that have remote
start those are typically the higher
frequencies like 902 megahertz you
cannot use any of these keys to generate
that you have to have this key so now
that I''ve shown you guys some of the
available Universal keys for the autel
let''s go ahead and generate one and
program it to a vehicle alright guys so
we''re going to be generating a key and
programming it to a 2022 Nissan Altima
not what I like to start by doing is
going online to a website like
uhshardware.com punching in the make and
model of the vehicle that we''re going to
be programming a key to and finding the
correct FCC ID for the key we need to
generate so on the tool we''re going to
start by going to Universal key we''re
going to select Nissan
for the model we''re going to select
Ultima for the year we''re going to
select 2022. again the important thing
is that we find the correct FCC ID and
also the button configuration now this
vehicle originally does come with remote
start however the customer bought this
vehicle from a used car lot and the key
that they gave him was a key without
remote start so obviously at some point
in time they had lost the keys and
whoever sold them the keys sold them a
key without remote start now the key
still functions and everything however
the customer does want the remote start
function because of course his car comes
equipped with it now I did already
successfully add a key to this one the
remote start works great however the
customer did call me back because now he
wants a second key so that''s what we''re
going to be doing today so we''re going
to scroll through these FCC IDs and
we''re going to locate the five button
remote start key that has fccid
kr5tx N4 there''s our key right there as
you can see it is the five button with
the remote start and so before we can
generate this key we are going to have
to put a battery in it again these
Universal keys do not come with
batteries so you do have to buy them
separately in this case they use a
CR2032 battery so we''re basically just
going to take this part of the shell
we''re going to pop in the battery then
we''re going to take the other half of
the shell and then we''re going to put it
together line it up correctly
then just pop it back together
now our key has a battery in it and it''s
ready to generate so we''ll go ahead and
drop it into the slot and hit generate
Universal key
as you can see it''s generating our key
this should only take about a minute or
so
key generation is completed and now our
key is ready to program to the vehicle
okay guys so 2022 Nissan Altima again
I''ve got the km100 right here you can
see I''ve already got the Bluetooth
dongle connected and over here on the
center console I''ve got three keys now
this one here is the original Nissan key
that''s already programmed to the vehicle
and this one is an oxtail generated ikey
that I already programmed everything
works great and this is the key here
that we''re going to be adding now the
way we''re going to do this today is
we''re going to do an all keys lost
situation that way we can erase all of
the previous keys that were in the
memory that no longer is with the
vehicle and so basically we''re going to
be starting fresh we''re going to go
ahead and start by going into emo
then we''re going to select Nissan
Right Here Nissan
let''s just go ahead and do automatic
selection
it''s telling us to turn the hazard
lights on so we''ll go ahead and hit the
hazard switch the hazard lights are now
on and it wants us to open and close the
door I''m going to go ahead and hit OK
it''s scanning the vehicle system okay so
I''m going to go into IMO status scan and
here it''s going to scan the modules and
if you look there are no dtc''s present
in the BCM so we''re going to go ahead
and do all keys lost guided I''m gonna go
ahead and shut the vehicle off
our hazard lights are still on and we''re
going to go ahead and hit start and it''s
going to obtain the pin number it tells
us execution of this function will erase
all keys so make sure you have all the
keys that you need to learn to the
vehicle ready we do so we''re going to
click yes turn the ignition off turn on
the hazard lights and open and close the
door we already did that so we''ll hit ok
now here it''s giving us a little warning
this is our BCM code that it pulled up
and it''s letting us know that if we have
one of these other BCM codes then
attempting this programming may be risky
some of these bcms can actually lock up
or become bricked just by doing the PIN
code reading and so you need to make
sure that your VIN number is not part of
this Blacklist now if you guys didn''t
know you could go online and Google
Nissan BCM Blacklist you''re going to
find a set of numbers and those are
going to be the bco numbers you want to
stay away from again our number here
does not match any of the ones on The
Blacklist so we''re going to go ahead and
click yes
now it''s telling us to place the
original smart key up against the button
so this here is our original I key I''m
going to put it up against the button
just in case you guys didn''t know our
ignition button is right here make sure
you have it where the emblem is right
where the button is we''re going to go
ahead and click OK establishing
communication okay so success it pulled
the PIN code now it''s telling us to push
the ignition switch and put the key that
you want to learn up against the button
so I''m going to push it
and you can see the instrument cluster
just came on and if you pay attention
the security light went off that is a
good sign so we''re going to go ahead and
hit OK turn off the ignition so let''s
push it again
ignition is off now we''ll hit OK program
success continue to program the next one
yes we''re basically going to do the same
thing with the next key so I''m going to
put the next key up against the push
button then we''re going to push it once
the instrument cluster comes on and pay
attention to that security light you see
how it went away that means our key is
now registered so we''re going to hit OK
it says turn the ignition off so we''ll
turn it off instrument cluster is now
off and then we''re going to hit OK
program success continue to the next one
yes now we''re basically going to do the
same thing with our final key this one
here put it up against the start button
and we''re going to push it
push it once instrument cluster should
light up
and pay attention to that security light
right there
it just went away and so we''re going to
hit OK
it says turn the ignition off
ignition is now off and we''ll hit OK
programming success continue to the next
one no now it''s telling us to put the
first key that was learned up against
the button that''s going to be this
original Nissan key so we''ll put it up
against the button and we''re going to
push it once
the instrument cluster should light up
instrument cluster came on so we''ll hit
ok now it says turn it off and wait for
three seconds so we''re gonna count to
three and you can see we already have a
message here key registration complete
and so now we should be ready to hit OK
programming complete check if remote
control is operating properly start the
engine and wait for five seconds so I''m
going to hit OK
and we should be done here with the tool
yep so we have success there all the way
around now I''m going to go ahead and
shut the hazard lights off then I''m
going to open and close the door then
we''re going to check to see if our
remotes work so we''ll start with the
original one lock
unlock that works we''ll go ahead and try
the second one so lock
and unlock
that works
and then we''ll try the third one lock
unlock now let''s go ahead and try to
start the vehicle so foot on the brake
pedal hit the start button
and car starts up right away and just
like that we''re done all right guys so
before we end off the video a couple
things I wanted to mention about the
tool number one is that this thing
actually comes with the built-in apb112
if you guys aren''t familiar with that
basically what it is is a key simulator
and it can be used in order to do an all
keys lost situation on a newer Toyota
now the apb112 is an item that has to be
purchased separately if you guys have
either an im508 or the im506 they do not
come with the tools when you buy them
and the simulator is usually somewhere
between two and three hundred dollars
now the simulator is really useful if
you run into an all keys lost situation
on a newer Toyota the newer Toyotas
require a 12-digit rolling pin code and
so what you can do on some of these is
actually read the eprom information by
OBD using the tool then with that eprom
information this thing can actually
simulate the key that was programmed to
the vehicle so you can actually start
the vehicle with the antenna on this
this also allows you to add a key easily
on these newer Toyotas by simulating the
original key and then using that to add
the second key so really cool feature to
have built into the tool like I said if
you guys have an im508 or an im608 it
does not come with it you have to buy
the apb112 separately with this km100
it''s built into the tool now second
thing I wanted to mention if you guys
are buying this tool in order to do
cloning by that I mean cloning of
transponders let it be known that the
vvdi Superchip from xhorse does not work
with this tool I know a lot of guys get
confused because that''s really the most
popular chip that''s on the market
however the vvdi Superchip does not work
with the auto now as far as what chips
do work with the odd cell I''m not
exactly sure though I have seen several
videos of people actually cloning chips
with this tool so I know that there are
some chips on the market that do work
with the autel I''m just not exactly sure
which ones other than that this tool is
one of my top five favorite tools that I
have in my possession this is easily the
first key programmer that I go for
anytime I go to program Keys simply
because it''s so portable and easy to use
now will it do everything no but it does
do probably 90 of the vehicles that I
program keys for and for for the rest
that this thing can''t do I have several
other tools for that and all those other
tools are a lot more expensive than this
one now if you guys are interested in
purchasing this product I will leave a
link down in the description below I do
want to let you guys know that I was not
paid to review this product I''m simply

Hey, what''s up? How''s everybody doing?
Welcome to my channel, Mike''s
Automotive. So, today we''re working with
the Honda Civic, you guys. And this is
like 2016 and up for push to start. Now,
the customer had a auto universal remote
pro into the vehicle.
And the thing is that it was kind of
working. It turns on the car when it
wants to. It doesn''t turn on. Sometimes
it does. So, she''s like, "Hey, I''m just
going to get an OEM smart key and just
go ahead and program it." So, I said,
"All right." So, we''re going to be using
our auto. Go ahead and make sure you
have your uh emergency lights on if you
can''t turn it on. If you can turn it on,
turn it on. Okay. Now, um we''re going to
go to automatic uh VIN scan. So, it''s
going to automatically search for the
vehicle using the VIN. Um like I said,
if you can turn it on, turn it on. We''re
going to select smart key.
We''re going to do a push to start. Okay?
Because it''s push to start.
Um, as you guys can see, there''s
information right there for Civic.
Um, we''re going to We always go through
MMO status scan just because it it does
the the scan of the MMO system and it
lets us know something''s wrong with it
um or anything. So, it says is ignition
turned on by pressing the start button.
If you can turn it on, yes. If you can
press no.
So, um, we''re going to go ahead and scan
it. You guys can see it has the smart
system on here and then the immo system.
So, the smart system would be like
anything that''s keyless, any modules
that are that can pick it up, you know,
the immo system, of course, is the
immobilizer system that immobilizes a
vehicle if it''s not the correct key. So,
um, we''re going to go through all keys
lost. Actually, if you have a key, you
can go through add a key, but I''m going
to go through all keys lost because at
the end of the day, their key didn''t
want to turn on the car and off when it
needed to. And this requires you to turn
on and off the car. So, it says to place
the key to be learned in the vehicle and
take all the other keys out.
Is the ignition turned on by pressing
on? Um, no. We can''t turn it on. So,
we''re going to press no. It says press
and hold the start button. So, we''re
going to press and hold the start button
until the until the ignition uh turns on
and the cluster turns on and all the
lights, everything kind of like
accessory mode.
Um, is ignition switched on? Please
release the ignition. We''re going to
press okay.
Okay, here''s the next step. whether it''s
a newer model generally refers to after
2020. We''re going to press no because
it''s not over 2020. It''s like 16 through
18.
Now it''s establish establishing vehicle
communication.
Okay. Checking condition of the vehicle.
Please wait.
Keep program success. Would you like to
program the next one?
Press yes if you have another one. Press
no if you don''t have another one. So
it''s telling us to press the start
button.
Okay, to turn it off.
Now it says to turn it on. So basically
for all Honda, this is how it is. Turn
it off. Turn it on.
So you might have to um
Okay. Are both the keys
keyless? Is indicator immobilizer light
off? Yes, it''s off. We''re going to press
yes. Now again, it''s going to tell us to
shut it off. So, we''re going to press
it.
Now, it says to turn it on. Okay. Now,
now you''re going to have to press it
twice to turn it on every time you press
it. So, press it twice to turn it off
and once, excuse me, press it twice to
turn it on and once to turn it off. As
you guys can see, the registration is
complete. Okay, turn it off. Press it
once to turn it off. Now, don''t put your
foot on the brake, okay? Like, do not
start the actual vehicle. It just wants
you to put it in accessory mode. As you
guys can see, excuse me, it''s
programmed. The remote works. Everything
works perfectly. Um, please don''t forget

is programming a smart key to a 2016 and
up Honda Civic using our Autel IM 608

going to show you how you can program a
Honda Accord key uh to work with your
car so today I''ve got a 2009 Honda cord
now this pretty much works with all
modern Honda cords um if you''ve got the
key then you''re all set if you got if
you got a key like this then this will
work they all pretty much have the same
concept so um what you want to do is
first of all I I''m going to change this
key this is an old uh key that''s broken
and this is the original key that came
with this car but unfortunately it''s
broken so you''re going to need the
original key or just the key a key that
you use with your car that''s going to
turn the ignition um and you''re going to
need this of course so you probably have
this already and I bought this from eBay
I saved uh
around 180 bucks buying this this was
for
$14 um and it''s not copied yet but I''m
going to go to Ace and they''re going to
copy this for me and uh Hey I''m going to
save around 180 bucks just doing this if
I go to Honda and they copy the key and
program it for me I''m going to have to
spend
$200 which is a total waste so I''m going
to do it myself and I highly recommend
you guys do it too so anyways we''re
going to go ahead and program this so
all you want to do is you want to grabb
your original
key and then you want to go to your
ignition and what you want to do is you
want to insert the key in there all
right so what we''re going to do is we
are going to turn the ignition on to
number two so if you see right there
there are numbers so this is zero one
two and three three will turn your
engine on two will turn your radio and
your uh pretty much your AC on and one
will just put your car in
standby uh but it will not as you can
see there the time the timer is on but
the radio is not on um so uh actually
the radio is on but the AC is not on so
if I go to two it''s going to turn on the
AC and the
dashboard so what we''re going to do is
we''re going to go on to number two and
we''re going to do this every time I''m
going to turn off the AC so what what
you want to do is you want to press
block you see that
led now go
back go to number two
again
Lock close the
car go to number
two
Lock close
this now you want to go back to number
lock
close the
car go to number two
again you see that you guys hear that
the car just locked so I''m going to lock
it and then I''m going to open
it as you can see there we just
programmed this for
free so we''re going to step out the
car and it''s
nighttime I''m going to close
this
and we''re going to get
close and we''re going to lock it using
this new key let me just focus this
so lock
it you see there just locked the car
with the new
key we''re locking the

easiest, and most economical way to make
a spare key for a Honda or Acura View. I
apologize for any wind noise in the
audio today. Hopefully, you can still
hear me well. Before I jump in the car
and show you how easy it is to program
this key, I''m going to start this phone
call to the Honda dealership to find out
what they''re going to charge and how
long they would take to make a spare
key. With the call underway, let''s jump
in and start programming this spare key.
At tomsky.com, you can order spare keys,
programming device, and be sure you
include our optional key by photo
service. More on that later. As you
begin programming, it''s important to
know you must have one working key that
starts the engine. This one with the
tile keyfinder, so I can always find my
keys. Fires the engine up. The remote
buttons on this key still work. But even
if they don''t, as long as you have a key
that starts the engine, you can use
Tom''s Key Company do-it-yourself
solutions to help make a spare key for
your vehicle. All right, to start out,
we got to scan the QR code. With the app
installed, we''re ready to begin
programming. Your spare key will need to
be cut to fit your vehicle. I recommend
using our key by photo key cutting
service. It''ll save you a bunch of time
and hassle by having your Q drive
already cut to fit your vehicle. So,
we''re gonna pair key. We need to find
the OBD port and plug in this
programming device. On most vehicles,
it''s down near the gas and brake pedal.
Sometimes it can be behind a little
cover here. This cord, it''s right
there. That thing plugged in. To make
your life a little easier, you can grab
this optional extension cable to see
what''s going on with the programmer.
Now I can see that my programmer has
power. We''ve got to get the Bluetooth
communication working. All right, we
need to find the device. There''s a
matching serial number here. May need to
press to scan. Let''s see if we can get
our Bluetooth connection
made. And there we go. We saw the com
light turn on. We''re ready to
continue. Okay. It''s helpful to know
that there is technical support
available Monday through Friday daytime
business hours. So that can be really
helpful if you run into problems. Let''s
begin
programming. Okay, calibrating the tool.
We need to enter license plate for scan
the VIN. This isn''t 100% foolproof, but
let''s go give it a shot. I''m going to go
try the license
plate. Enter license plate. Here we go.
2017 Honda Accord. That is correct for
this vehicle. All right. This is a
turnkey
ignition. So, we''ll do the key version.
Smart key is a push button start
ignition. All right, some important
points. Might take up to 15 minutes, but
no longer than that. Don''t leave the app
during programming. And be sure you''ve
got all existing keys previously
programmed, like this one, as well as
any new ones that are going to be
made. Okay, let''s begin programming.
While this is initiating, let me tell
you a couple important things. While you
do this, I recommend you turn off the
HVAC, heating, cooling, roll down the
windows if it''s hot day, turn off the
headlights, the radio, anything that''s
drawing battery from the vehicle because
you don''t want your vehicle battery to
run out during the programming process.
You could even connect a trickle charger
to your battery if you''re concerned it
might be weak. Let''s see how that phone
call with car dealership''s
gone. Still a lot of
old. While we''re waiting, let me tell
you about our key by photo key cutting
service. This is pretty amazing stuff.
When you place your order, you can add
our optional key by photo key cutting
service. You''re going to snap a few
photos of your key, move it around to
get different angles with the phone
directly above the key, sitting on a
flat surface like a table. You want us
to be able to see with the photo the
proper cuts to make. Then using our
keyby key cutting technology, we''ll cut
your new key to fit your vehicle. It''s
pretty amazing. It''ll arrive already
fitting. Okay, we''re almost done here.
Getting ready. Please
wait. All right. Turn the ignition two
clicks forward to the on position. Don''t
start the engine using your currently
programmed key. Okay, let''s
continue. Make sure the ignition is in
the on position with the engine off with
the currently programmed key before
clicking continue. Yes, that is correct.
Engine''s not running. I do see some
lights on the dashboard.
Continue. Please wait.
Turn the ignition off. Do not remove the
key. Okay. One two. Ignition is off.
Please wait. If you run into a little
problem, you can contact techport. You
might try starting
over. Please wait. Turn the ignition on
again using the same
key. There you go. One.
Two. Reading the key. Please wait.
key. One, two. Remove the key from the
ignition less than 15 seconds. Insert
new key and turn two clicks to the on
position. Okay, here''s a new one.
Putting it in. One,
two. I look on the dash. I notice a
green security light blinking. That''s a
good sign. Part of programming process.
key. One. Two. Security light is still
blinking. Turn the ignition on again
with the same key. One,
two. Turn the ignition off. Security
light continues to
blink. Turn the ignition on again. Same
key. One, two. I''ve noticed now that the
security light has turned off. Okay. Is
the security light flashing or on at
this time? No, the security light has
turned off. No, it is turned off. Turn
the ignition off. Do not remove the
key. One,
two. Turn the ignition off again with
the same
key. Okay, please wait. Success.
Awesome. Programming successful. Before
I test this out, let''s see how the phone
call with the car dealership''s going.
Hi. I''m trying to find out what it costs
to get a uh another key for 2017
Accord. Yep. 137. 137. Awesome. And uh

Um, and how long does that take?
One full service day. A full service
day. So, like I got to drop the car off.

little bit of time there.
you would drop it off and then you''d be
able to get it back.
Do you know if there''s any faster or
cheaper ways like I might any church out
there to get a park team made?
All right. Uh thank you so much for the
info. Can you believe that?
$330 and drop the car off for the entire
day at the dealership. Why would anyone

with our key by photo, send you the
programming device, and in about 10
minutes, you''ll have a spare and save a

device. Here we go. Let''s test out our
new
key. Crank the engine. There we go.
Engine fires right up. Isn''t that
awesome? Now, I do want to make sure my

nicely. Let''s check the lock and unlock
buttons now. Here''s the original
key. It works great. Here''s the new

vehicle information sometimes the VIN
scanner works sometimes it doesn''t so
I''m just going to go ahead and plug in
that we''ve got a Honda this is a CRV
and notice there''s a couple different
ranges 2015 to 2020 and if you come in
here this one''s asking for a smart key
we don''t have a smart key a smart key
you''d push a button on your dashboard to
start the engine this one we put a key
in and turn it to start the engine so
that''s wrong we got to come back to the
2001 to 2020. this is a 2014 CRV that
we''re working on today
and we''ve got a blade key okay I''m going
to take my original key put it in the
ignition and turn it two clicks to the
on position I''m not starting the engine
foreign
we''ve got some communication going on
so give us some instructions we need a
paired key required to perform
programming so we need a working key
that already starts the engine we can
make up to five keys and we''re selecting
what kind of keys program so what''s
going to happen is we''re going to try
this key that has the key with remote if
that doesn''t work we may need to do this
option over here we''re going to make two
keys and none of those we''ll come back
and do this if the remote isn''t working
after the first programming okay turn
off the ignition
turn the ignition on with the paired key
so this is our original key
it''s important there''s timing
requirements so you gotta follow the
timing carefully within 30 seconds we''re
going to turn off the ignition
and we''re going to turn it back on now
okay it tells us there''s three keys
paired to this vehicle already
turn off the ignition
turn on the ignition with an unpaired
key so that means I''ve got to take my
new key
pull out the working one put one of the
new ones in
turn that ignition on I''m not trying to
start the engine
and we''re going to turn off the ignition
okay turn on the ignition
on these Hondas you go through that a
little bit on and off on the dashboard
right now you may notice there''s a
blinking green security light and that''s
normal that''s part of the programming
process when the key works that light
will not be on turn off the ignition
turn on the ignition
okay we''ve now got four keys so this one
works
all right turn off the ignition
so turn on the ignition with an unpaired
key so we''re taking our second spare key
now no key ring
I''m gonna put it in
strangely it did not get our fifth key
so no the security is not off it failed
to pair the key I''m gonna take this out
remember this is the one we haven''t
programmed yet
if I try to start the engine
see how the security light turns on is
all then it''s just blinking so it''s not
working
I''m going to come back in here we''re
gonna run this app again got a Honda
CRV and the 2001 to 2020 is the one that
had the blade key so I''m taking my
original working key turning the
ignition on
I''m not starting the engine
it''s turned all the dashboard lights on
phone tells us it''s busy communicating
all right
we just need to make one of these
okay turn on the ignition with a paired
key so a working key original working
cue that''s already paired to the vehicle
tells me there''s four Keys okay
so we know we have four Keys already for
this vehicle

we just made two spare keys for this
vehicle now we got three keys to use
unfortunately because this is used
vehicle there''s two other keys out out
there somewhere in the world have been
lost in somebody''s drawer somewhere that
start this vehicle but now we''ve got
three spare keys so if we lose a key
we''ll always have a spare note all right
let''s test the buttons let''s make sure
our remotes work lock unlock
and here''s the original
okay they all work
let''s start the engine with this new one

the AL key there is a key I''m coming to
generate this key to program the car the
car the client bought the car brand new
so a used car so he wants me
to give him another key so that even if
they have spare key they can''t move the
car so I''ll do all key loss and add two
keys to the system so you can see this
ID 47
this ID 47 so I''m coming to generate the
key and I have to test the frequency
also to know the kind of frequency the
vehicle is
using so let me do the
test this 4 ter um Sorry 4 teritory
yeah so I''ll know the kind of key to
generate for the system so now as I know
the chip ID and
the course now I know the chip because
now I know the chip ID I know the car
I''m working with so it''s
Honda and I have to do all KY losw for
the client so
that
CRV I really don''t know the year so I''ll
choose 2019 or 2018
and you can see the key start from 2017
to 2020 and it is 433 and it is the same
key type it is the same key type so I''ll
place it here with the remote in
it so I''ll place it here with the remote
in it then let me continue this is the
key that I want to generate so let me do
generate and for my for my km 100 I
misplaced my
I misplaced
my VCI so now I have to buy new VCI
before I can use the km 100 so I''m using
it for only key generation because if I
use the programmer I have to get um 12
volt power supply to it and I don''t want
to go through that stress so with this
one what I''ll do is I''ll wait for it to
finish
generating for it to finish generating
the
key but for now it has to upgrade the
key so if you can see it upgrade it then
after the upgrade it''s now upgrading the
key boot loader before it''s going to
before it to generate the key it has to
do all these things before it will
generate the original key for me to use
so I think it is done with the boot
loader so it''s now detecting the key and
it''s now generating the universal key
which will take almost a minute
which is 60
seconds so I''ll just wait for it to
finish with the key
generation so these are the new keys
that I''ve bought to do this kind of
works so that if my clients buy new
vehicles and they don''t really trust one
or two things I raise all the keys and
add another key for them to secure the
car for them so that no one can just
come and drive the car and move because
it''s something they do a lot they will
sell the key to they will sell the card
to you and give you one key then later
in the days or maybe in months they will
come and drive the car off and move away
if you don''t register it even if you
register they do that so I''ll do this
key for my clients then I''ll go and do
the programming or key lost but I''ll be
using the IM uh the IM 60 because i'' I
don''t have my VCI with me if I had the
VCI complete if I had the VCI I could
have just used my VCI to do the
programming so let me read the key ID
and see if it is ID
47 yeah it is ID 47 it is not locked so
go back again
and exit and go to frequency and test
the frequenc frequency and make sure the
frequency matches the original
key yeah 433 and there is the original
key for the vehicle that one also is
433 yeah and this one also is
433 yeah so I''ll add the
key then I''ll call it the fix thank you
for watching subscribe to my channel for
more videos so the ignition is able to
turn on because I have the two keys this
is the new one I''m programming you can
see the difference this is the new one

emot

don''t need to do that because the

system but my client has only one key so
only one key was given to my client so

working on just let me know in the
comments and I''ll put it up as soon as I
can thanks and I hope you enjoy watching
my
videos all right we are working on a 20
20 Honda CRV uh Pro key it''s an all keys
lost she wants two keys um I''m going to
go ahead and generate the altel
universal um I have this key but I want
to just make a video on generating this
I''ve selected the year making model
Honda they only have uh two
possibilities or two fcci IDs for these
style proc key so you''re not going to
get it wrong but just wanted to make a
video on how to make this key I love
these all Keys I''ve said it in another
video this key it''s always going to work
so I''ve selected it um got to put a
battery in this key they come without it
just pop it in the uh programmer up here
hit
generate generate Universal
key and it is going to make that key um
I''ve already made one I''ll pause this
while I get in the car and get that
started and uh we''ll be back on
programming all right back in the Honda
CRV going go through manual
selection CRV smart key push to
start uh we''re going to select control
unit keyless system
Honda this turn on by pressing start
button twice no it''s going to tell you
to hold the ignition button about 15
seconds to turn it
on so a pretty common problem on these
vehicles Honda push to start vehicles um
once you get through I''ll tell you when
we get there but if you get to
programming failed and you know you have
the right key part of the process on
these is only having one key in the car
so even though I''m making two you have
to do these one by one and you have to
keep the other one it says something
like 5 to 10
m and it ends up being right
um let''s get this figure it out first
let''s not do
this I know we have I got a blue light
on my
OBD let''s try this again
I got the lights on I know the car is
awake um if you get to key failed one of
their keys is still in here I''ve had it
happen multiple
times um like I said I''ll explain it
better when we get to that step but if
there is a key an existing key in here
or any other Honda procs really it''s
going to fail because when it when it
opens programming to take your key in if
it sees two it''s going to fail you out
of it and I don''t know why but twice now
I found the existing key that the owner
of the car thought they lost in the
passenger uh seat track under up under
the seat don''t ask me why but take a
shot at it if you get to that step uh
this is not going well I''m going to
switch the auto proad and be
back all right we are on a 2020 Honda
CRV um I generated to two keys with the
im608 with the altel universal Keys just
because I like those
keys and I know they are always going to
work as long as I generate the correct
key
um we''re adding this is all keys lost
situation we''re adding two proximity
Keys we''ll try auto
search Miss does not turn on Okay now
we''re going to hold
it it''s going to kick the alarm back
on shut the door get rid of some of that
noise at
least
okay smart key button to
start yes the ignition is
on we''re going to do all smart Keys lost
okay
um take mares out of the car more than
two meters away it is pretty serious
about that distance I was I tried this
one time by I was on top of a car hauler
by hanging off the car with my with the
key in my hand it was a good 5 ft away
and it wasn''t enough so you really need
to get the other key as far away as you
can um what I do with these is put the
key that I want programmed on top of for
the dash um you can put it on the seat
there''s antennas everywhere in this car
that''s never failed me do center console
seat um that usually works but I am
going to put this key pretty far
away sorry about the horn nothing I can
do about
it get back in the car hit okay and it''s
pretty much just going to say it took
that key
switch is on please turn that one off we
are making two keys
here all right we took that
key so we''re going to switch keys
so at that step if it had said
failed that means there is another key
in this car somewhere I''ve had it
happened multiple times owner can''t find
their key calls us for all keys lost if
it fails at that step their key is
somewhere in this car and by luck it''s
worth a shot for you I''ve twice found it
in the seat track for the passenger seat
don''t ask me why but if you get there
give it a shot it might work so we''ve
switched keys I took the one it took
took out put the new smart key
in vehicle is recognizing the
key switch the ignition
off switch ignition
on security light is
extinguished
yes back off
double tap back
on off
again my goodness back
on program
success so we''ll cut it off try this
one oh I think I got oh yep that''s good
this one is good we''ll start the car it
is a hybrid so we''re not going to hear
it maybe you can hear that that''s on I''m
going to swap keys out try my other key
make sure they took them both I''m not I
usually do this with the Im so I''m not
really familiar with the process on the
propad but we got lock and unlock so

Honda CRV hybrid.
Hello everyone. Today we''ll go over the
step-by-step instructions to add an
additional key using this pro key box
kit. You must have one working key to
add any additional key. This kit is
compatible with many Honda models. I
will add compatibility list at the end
of this video. This kit comes with the
aftermarket key, the programmer tool,
and the instruction manual. If you have
your own unprogrammed key, you can
purchase the programmer separately. This
tool will work on original or
aftermarket key. Today, we''ll program
the aftermarket key with the kit. Once
you use this programmer tool, it will
lock to your car vin. This means you can
reuse it many times in your vehicle, but
you cannot use it in any other vehicle.
So, to begin the process, you need to
connect the tool to the OBD board.
Once you connect it, take the new
unprogrammed key out of the vehicle and
only keep the programmed working key in
the vehicle.
Turn the ignition on, but do not start
the car.
From there, press button B and wait for
the blue light.
[Music]
Then take the working key out of the
vehicle and wait for the yellow light.
Once the yellow is blinking, bring in
the new unprogrammed key into the
vehicle and wait for the red and blue
lights to blink.
Once the red and blue are blinking, turn
the ignition off.
Then turn it back on.
We will repeat this three more times.
At the fourth time, you will hear the
tool long beep indicating the
programming is successful. And now it''s
all done. Your key is ready to go. You
can test your key by starting the
vehicle.
As you can see here, it''s working. Hope
you enjoyed the video. Thank you for

only one key here and I I''ll show you
this a good working key because I have
it here and I
can turn it on and ignition on and it
works I have here another one that I
bought that it doesn''t work so if I take
this one out that''s out of the car I
just put it around
there and I just keep this in when I try
to turn it on it complains it
says to start hold remote near so this
one doesn''t work right now if I bring
the other one back
in it should work
now yeah it doesn''t complain so I have
this autel and let let me show you
you the
mk808 K BT Bluetooth so I have it here
with me so I connected the mini VCI here
on the OBD board
yep so with the vehicle on and the VCI
MINI
Connected let''s go into the tool
Diagnostics Honda
system
selection if I select USA for some
reason it doesn''t show the
2014 so I''m going to have to use with
the go with the
general and this is what I would have Ed
you''ll see it in a
second yeah 2014
cic
yes it was hot
[Music]
functions in
moys yes it is the one push start
here you have to go through a lot of uh
menus there I think it only
one
culus now I think it says registration
or something like that
yeah
registration keyless access
remotes so we''re going to add
one and be careful and read everything
pretty much here we have done all these
things add keyless remote we''re in that
step so now from here on we have to pay
attention to what it
says so follow on the screen so when
you''re finished turn on the ignition
switch to off okay let''s go
so it must be one register keyless
remote which is the one that we already
have
now uh the keyless remote that is
capable of starting the engine must be
in the vehicle right now it is and I
also have the other one that I want to
configure in the vehicle I think at one
point I have to take it out of the car
the ignition must be switched to on
which is right now using the keyless
remote okay let let''s go and it''s
important also ensure the following to
reduce noise as much as possible during
keyless remote rest stration turn off
all the electrical devices so I turn off
the
radio um any dash cam that you may have
any Chargers anything like that uh turn
off all electrical devices navigation on
your system separate on the diagnostic
tool which is what we''re looking right
now from the keyless remote as much as
possible so I''m going to actually put it
maybe let it here there
um close all doors windows and sound
roofs yep it is and we can lock
them I can lock Jus is I don''t
know yep my windows were down because
I''m it''s h in
here okay this is a good sign
let''s take one original keyless access
remote into the vehicle right now it is
remove all other keyless access remotes
from the vehicle so here''s the good one
and here''s the bad the one that I want
to
configure let''s close
everything do not insert the keyless
access remote
vehicle um access remote slot is there''s
no slot here press the okay
button turn the ignition switch on
and good way is to do it like
this just in case to be close for the
immobilizer to be
red okay most likely what it''s doing now
it''s reading this key that is working
completely take all the original keyless
access remotes out out of the vehicle
remaining time 94 seconds all right now
I''m going to take it
out here it goes the good
one now it''s complaining of
course press okay to
continue
there only take one keyless access
remote into a vehicle
the new one let''s put the new
one in here okay so I BR in the new key
into the car I pressed okay and it said
key register successfully so I only have
the the old the new key inside that I
want to configure and it says now turn
it off so I''m going to turn it off like
this
boom now it says turning on by using the
no ignition whatever that is but try to
do this with a key super close one
two now let''s
see are both keyless imobilizer lights
to turn off yeah I don''t see any lights
that says complains that this is not a a
u yeah I don''t see any one any place
that says this is not a good key so
we''re going to press yes
yep completed okay so let''s try with
this key to start the car I''m pressing
the the brake right now well it says
turn it off wait turn it off first so

to follow it so turn it
on I only have the new key in it''s done

2010 Honda Fit and what we''re doing
car is for reprogramming she didn''t have
a key fob for a car she has each type of
keys and she has no key file she just
got this car about a month ago and one
of the key fob so I''m just going to
reprogram the keys real quick this is a
key fighter you can get like an Amazon
or something that we think I think we
pay about 20 bucks for it now when you
get these with the key on it they''re not
cut obviously so you''ll have to take
them somewhere and get them cut but they
charge fifty five dollars to program
them so anyway twenty dollars for the
five and the key and then get a cut and
then we can use the launch here and
we''ll do a program on it it''s probably
going to have a three program all the
keys she has one key already without the
fob and then she bought two keys she got
this key and normal key that she wants a
program so we''re just got a program
these two new ones the five and then
probably have a probably have us
reprogram the other one she has usually
what it does is it''ll just have your
program vault once so right now it wants
to do a little firmware upgrade
something to let it do that anyway so
this is a you know like I said I think
the average price usually is about 55 or
60 bucks to program a key might be more
to dealership I''m not sure so if you
have if you know if someone that has an
auto or a launch it''s something that can
be done pretty quickly and maybe if you
know someone has one just throw them a
couple bucks and they can do it but
anyway we''ll go through the process here
I''m gonna get set up and we''ll go
through the process and reprogram these
keys real fast all right so this is the
this is the key that she had with the
car and you can see here if you put it
in
car starts right up and there''s no
issues at all with it you can see it''s
still running so when you get these keys
that are programmed and I lost them
it''s like this key here it''s cut it''ll
fit in the ignition but what''s gonna
happen when you turn it it''ll start and
die see the car is running and then it
dies right away if you have this Queen
key light right here flashing and that''s
because you know it''s not programmed to
the ECM so that''s the one with the key
fob then we have this other one that you
got it''ll do the same thing you''ll start
the car for a few seconds and then it
should you see their car starts dies
it''s about two seconds the green lights
flashing so we''re gonna fix that now so
what we''re going to do is go into so
we''re going to go in the Honda
put the key back in here trying to get
off a little bear here
of course you got this set up first
and we''re going out of keys find the
keys on here mobilizer
all right we''re gonna hit select keys
I''m gonna hit the wrong thing select
keys we''re just gonna add one key right
now so it''s the turn is to switch off
now it says turn to this and switch
along with the original key so we''re
going to do that now it says turn D this
switch off at the 17 seconds so we''re
doing that now it says turning this to
switch on with a new key within 20
seconds so we''re doing that now just
turn it off within 15 seconds now just
turn it on without changing the keys or
the new keys still in the ignition on
it''s asking if the immobilizer light
went off that''s the green key light so
we''re gonna hit yes now saying turn it
back off now it''s saying turn it on with
the original key so we''ll switch it back
over to the original key
now just turn the bag off okay it''s a
lot of uh now it says make sure it
starts with all the keys that we
programmed which we just program one for
now
so that''s turning the switch on so now
this is the new key the one that she
bought with the five and there you go
you can see it''s running the immobilizer
light is off so that particular key that
we just got is programmed and then now
we''ll try the factory key one more time
for the one that you got originally so
now I''ll fill the floor so now we''re
going to put our original key back in
does have a fob
and of course that one still looks good
so that was how you do if you''re just
gonna add one key since we have three
keys total all right since we got she
found another key so since we got four
keys total we''re just gonna rewrite them
all at the same time so right now we
have two that work but we''re not gonna
just add one key we''re gonna add two
more keys so somehow we got four keys
this car so she should never have a
problem losing the key on this car so
anyway it says how many keys you want to
register a maximum of six we''re gonna
say four hit okay now it says turn this
to switch off I got a few that''s going
to be a lot of on and off on and off
turn it on turn it off
now Susteren on with another key within
20 seconds turn it off turn it off
another key within 20 seconds so all I''m
doing is just going through the four
keys we have turn it off and then last
one via 4th keys to turn it on turn it
off now that''s when you turn it back on
without switching the key so I got the
fourth key in there just turn it off and
then back on the immobilizer light is
off so is turning the switch off now it
says turn on with the original key
all right so saying all four keys should
be registered so let''s test on this is
the original key
and you can see their mobilizers off and
it''s running so I go through real quick
and check off for these that''s the first
one this is the second one
you can see it''s just a lot turning the
keys on and off and switching the keys
around this one works go for the third
one and I guess I''m hiding that you can
have six in the ECM at one time this car
has four so that''s this one and then
this would be the last one the fourth
one all right
so these are all working jobs done for
her so you can tell you can see here if
you have an auto our launch is pretty
easy to reprogram the keys and the fobs
even if you have see you have a key five
and you lose it a lot of times you can
program the fives with Outlook skiing
tool but some of them you can''t in the
launch the auto can program those so I
know not everybody has access to one of
these types of skiing tools they''re
pretty expensive but if you know someone
that has one it''s pretty good it''s a
good it''s a nice option to have on this
type of scam tool and if you''re in the
st. Louis area you can contact me
through either Facebook or YouTube and I
come out and program your five or your
key for you usually charge twenty five
for that really depends on how many I
have and how far you are for where I''m
at but that is something that I can do
that''s something that I do do I go
places in program I just recently
programmed a couple key files for a guy
so that is something I can come to you
and do the only thing I don''t cut keys
so if you need your keys cut or
something like that I won''t be able to
do that for you
got to take that to a locksmith and
they''ll cut it for you but if you got a
key cut or if you got a replacement key
five you can save a lot of money call
someone like me and will come out and
reprogram it instead of take it to a
dealer another dealer it''s outrageous to
get this done and anyway so that''s
something I can do probably 10-15
minutes in your driveway if you live the
st. Louis area and if you do have a
problem Amazon is a good source for
those bob''s or the keys the keys are a
lot cheaper too through Amazon like I
said we got this key here that''s a key
fob built in with the key for $20 on the
amazon and then she had a cut to her
original key and then I just you know
you saw me reprogram it so and I think
they the locksmith won it I think a
hundred and ten for this key and the
program and cut it so she saved quite a
bit of money getting surprised at least
fifty bucks getting this on the Amazon
that having me come out
program it so anyway that''s it I''m gonna
go ahead and shut the launch down and
give all the keys back to her and she''ll
be on the way and this should be it
thanks for watching and like I said if
you are the st. Louis area go ahead and
contact me you through Facebook or
YouTube and I''ll come out and probably
I''m 45 or Yorkie for you and anyway
thanks for watching and we''ll see you on

you guys for watching. Today another
episode. We''re working on a 2017
Honda
HRV. So, what we''re doing here is we''re
adding a key. We''re working with the
Altel KM100. If you see that type of
remote, I did generate that remote with
the Xhorse Promax tool. And then that''s
a XN remote that we''re using here. So
once I generated that remote, I''m able
to go ahead and program this key
specifically to this vehicle. So what
we''re doing here, we do have the key on
the on position and we''re doing an auto
detect to go ahead and just extract the
data. So it can go ahead and connect to
the the computer so it can retrieve all
the information. If you could see there,
it''s giving you some option if it''s a
smart key, a blade key. So we go ahead
and choose it''s a blade key. Then we''re
going to go to the hot functions and
choose that option. And then it''s going
to go ahead and communicate with the
computer.
So there it''s a fourth keyblade system.
So here all we''re doing is adding a key
since we have the original key handy.
So we''re going to go ahead and start
with the original key in the ignition.
That''s going to give you step-by-step
instructions here.
So, if you see there, it''s basically
checking the security system. Since we
have an original key, it''s going to
bypass the security system. And so, it
did. Then, it''s going to tell you to
turn the ignition off. Then, turn the
ignition on
using the registered key within 17
seconds.
And now it says key programming
succeeded. But basically, if you want to
program the new key, you push yes.
So, what it''s going to do is going to
tell you to remove the original key and
then add the new key into the system.
So, if you can see there, the new key
has been programmed.
Then turn the ignition off. Then turn
the ignition on.
Then turn the ignition off.
Then turn the ignition on.
[Music]
Did the immobilizer light uh remove? And
yes, it did. It was not. Usually the
immobilizer will start blinking if it''s
not removed. But in this case it was
removed. So we went ahead and hit yes it
was removed.
Then if you can see there red key
numbers
number three. It was from two. Now we
added that key. Now it''s number three.
So that''s how we went ahead and
programmed the remote. And there you go.
It starts up the vehicle with no
security light on the dash. This was a
successful programming. If you guys have
any questions or concerns, please leave
me a comment on the on below and I''ll go
ahead and answer them as soon as I can.
Please like and subscribe to my channel.
I''ll go ahead and help you out in
anything you need. I know these new
locksmiths have a lot of questions, so
go ahead and ask away.', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

do a quick video
on a key program for a 2011 to 2017
honda odyssey
with the altel im 608 as you can tell
uh new key and then old key which is
very broken um so just wanted to walk
through this
and show you guys how the
all tell does with honda
so we''re just gonna go through
diagnostics then we''re gonna pick our
car
and we''re gonna go through and pick our
system
usa
so i used to use the varus edge on my
key programs and it did
most of um
most of the system or most of the cars
i''m sorry but um
unfortunately not too long ago i had
a couple acuras that i couldn''t do and i
had already told the customers that i
could do them
and so i called snap-on tech
and come to find out it was they were
still supposed to do it
but there was something wrong with the
software so they had to do an update and
it wouldn''t be fixed into the following
update
so then of course i had to take those
vehicles to um
i had to take before i get going too too
close in here let''s see
oops sorry i''m talking and then just
just walking through this here
um so anyway so yeah so i had to take
him to the dealer spend a couple hours
there pay the dealer to program them
it was a pain so that''s why i got the
im608 because i didn''t want to have to
deal with that
as well as i wanted to be able to do
multiple other keys as well
um so as you saw i went through
diagnostic diagnostics then i went
through system selection
and i chose immobilizer and then it
automatically detects
and then you go into a mobilizer setup
and it''ll load up here it''s pretty easy
and it
the great thing about the im608 is it
walks you through everything
um and honda''s are super easy anyways so
we''re gonna go add delete keys
and then
okay
let it load and we''re gonna add one key
normally you need to read all that stuff
especially if you''re doing something
you''ve never done so
turn the key off turn it back
on we''re gonna turn it off i''m sure and
then pull the key out put the new key in
that''s typically how this works
but i could be wrong because this is
actually the first time i''ve used the
im608
on a honda so
turn it off within 16 seconds okay on
the new key
put our new key in on
oh
on without changing the key
off again i think on one last time i
believe
so it''s real similar to the way
the varus edge did it and then actually
pretty similar to the way
the uh honda hds did as well when i was
at the dealership
um so is it mobilizer turned off
immobilizer light is
turned off so we go yes
turn it off key has been programmed
car starts cool
so we will do that okay off
and one last time
okay we already ensured that it started
the car
and this is the kia
switchblade key no
okay so let''s see sometimes
on these newer ones it actually programs
the lock and unlock
yep so it actually
the hook the hood''s open so it won''t
honk the horn but
you can see program that as well
plus obviously like i said it um
starts the car as well so that''s it it''s
that quick so this video is five minutes
long and you guys saw i uh
was messing around too so it''s super
quick so if you don''t uh have this
in as an option for yourself as
programming keys or as an option in your
shop
i highly recommend it um obviously this
is super easy they''re not all this easy
uh and it can be kind of nerve-wracking
sometimes
but i definitely highly recommend adding
the im608 to your arsenal of
scan tools it''s highly worth it i''ve
done lexus keys
as well already and toyota keys which
are easy as
well and i''m looking forward to jumping
in and doing some more
like ford keys and chevy keys and um i
know that this will actually skip the
uh like i think i forget i think it''s
the 10 minute uh
wait time on the gm''s so
uh that whole process i think it''s 30
minutes in total but you have to
constantly go back out turn the key off
and turn it on every like 10 minutes or
something like that it''s been a while
since i''ve done one but it''ll actually
bypass that
so anyways hopefully you guys liked the
video if you like the content feel free
to check out some of my other videos um
kind of just miscellaneous automotive
stuff so if you''re interested in that
stuff feel free to
subscribe like it if you like it if you
have any questions about the im608 feel
free to reach out i know there''s not a
ton a ton of information
um i can try to give you as much as i
can on my end
um so far there is a function viewer on
it as well which will tell you like
certain vehicles that it''ll do
which is really cool so it''ll go through
i wonder if i can do that real quick no
i''ll have to
exit out let''s see well maybe i can
function viewer
as you can see i''m recording on my phone
all right so you can see i''ve done it in
here a few times
so like uh lincoln so i
you go in and you type in which vehicle
you want and then it tells you like
each one of these what they record what
they um
represent so these symbols over here
and then it tells you what it''ll do
which is really cool
so i thought that was awesome so that
way you can check
before and if a customer calls you is
like hey i have like this customer
called me oops not a passport called me
on the linkedin and said hey i need a
key
i looked it up yes i can add keys no
problem so
that was really cool so awesome thanks

Honda Passport.
Hello everyone. Today we''ll go over the
step-by-step instructions to add an
additional key using this pro key box
kit. You must have one working key to
add any additional key. This kit is
compatible with many Honda models. I
will add compatibility list at the end
of this video. This kit comes with the
aftermarket key, the programmer tool,
and the instruction manual. If you have
your own unprogrammed key, you can
purchase the programmer separately. This
tool will work on original or
aftermarket key. Today, we''ll program
the aftermarket key with the kit. Once
you use this programmer tool, it will
lock to your car vin. This means you can
reuse it many times in your vehicle, but
you cannot use it in any other vehicle.
So, to begin the process, you need to
connect the tool to the OBD board.
Once you connect it, take the new
unprogrammed key out of the vehicle and
only keep the programmed working key in
the vehicle.
Turn the ignition on, but do not start
the car.
From there, press button B and wait for
the blue light.
[Music]
Then take the working key out of the
vehicle and wait for the yellow light.
Once the yellow is blinking, bring in
the new unprogrammed key into the
vehicle and wait for the red and blue
lights to blink.
Once the red and blue are blinking, turn
the ignition off.
Then turn it back on.
We will repeat this three more times.
At the fourth time, you will hear the
tool long beep indicating the
programming is successful. And now it''s
all done. Your key is ready to go. You
can test your key by starting the
vehicle.
As you can see here, it''s working. Hope
you enjoyed the video. Thank you for
watching.', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

I''ll put it up as soon as I can. Thanks,
and I hope you enjoy watching my videos.
All right, we are on a 2015 Honda Pilot
Touring. We''re doing a remote head key.
This is all keys lost. What I do with
basically all Hond''s except the newer
ones where the remote programs in with
the key, I will um onboard the remote
first to make sure you have the right
one. There''s only one option for this
one, but I did it anyway. I''ll do it
again just to show you how. Um, you turn
the key on to ignition, hit one of the
buttons, back off, on button. You do
that three times, and then it''s going to
cycle the locks. Hit a button on the
remote, turn it off, you''re good to go.
One,
two,
3,
four. There goes the locks. One more to
take my remote back off. So, we know
this remote works. We can go ahead and
program the key.
Um, I do auto propad. Any any programmer
will do these. It''s a pretty easy car. I
just use auto propad because it seems to
get in and read it a little bit quicker.
Do auto search. Ignition is already on.
That is the correct car. We''re on a
blade key.
Switch is still on.
This is why I use auto propad. Um, alt
tell takes a pretty good bit longer to
get that pulled.
We''re going to go to key.
All keys lost.
We''re going to be putting one key in.
Turn ignition off.
Back on. And on the third one, it''s
going to put the immobilizer light out
and we will be good.
Emoite is out. So, we are good to go.
Just got to get back out of programming.
Key registration complete. We''re good to
go. We''re going to turn it off to start
the car up.
Car starts.
It''s already locked.
Did I lose my remote?
That''s funny. I must have taken it back
out. We''ll throw it back in again. On.
Hit the button. Off. On.
Button. Off. On. Button. Off. On. Lock.
Cycle.
There''s my key. Back off. And now we
have remote back. Like I said, I had
already done it and I guess doing it
that second time took it out. But that''s
how you do that. We have working
buttons. Um the hatch on this car
doesn''t work. Uh his buttons don''t work
in the car, so the hatch is not going to
work. But we''re good to go.', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', '2025-12-10', 0, 0);

Hello everyone. Today we''ll go over the
step-by-step instructions to add an
additional key using this pro key box
kit. You must have one working key to
add any additional key. This kit is
compatible with many Honda models. I
will add compatibility list at the end
of this video. This kit comes with the
aftermarket key, the programmer tool,
and the instruction manual. If you have
your own unprogrammed key, you can
purchase the programmer separately. This
tool will work on original or
aftermarket key. Today, we''ll program
the aftermarket key with the kit. Once
you use this programmer tool, it will
lock to your car vin. This means you can
reuse it many times in your vehicle, but
you cannot use it in any other vehicle.
So, to begin the process, you need to
connect the tool to the OBD board.
Once you connect it, take the new
unprogrammed key out of the vehicle and
only keep the programmed working key in
the vehicle.
Turn the ignition on, but do not start
the car.
From there, press button B and wait for
the blue light.
[Music]
Then take the working key out of the
vehicle and wait for the yellow light.
Once the yellow is blinking, bring in
the new unprogrammed key into the
vehicle and wait for the red and blue
lights to blink.
Once the red and blue are blinking, turn
the ignition off.
Then turn it back on.
We will repeat this three more times.
At the fourth time, you will hear the
tool long beep indicating the
programming is successful. And now it''s
all done. Your key is ready to go. You
can test your key by starting the
vehicle.
As you can see here, it''s working. Hope
you enjoyed the video. Thank you for

remote
buttons
okay because this has to be programmed
what they call it onboard programming
sorry I did not actually uh video when
they''re actually doing it but basically
it''s fairly simple now with this
particular model basically you have to
before entering
um
Remote programming mode you have to
cycle
I''ll show you the step four times
instead of four times okay and until you
hear the uh the lock unlock cycle anyway
uh to be exact
basically uh just for demonstration
let''s say this is the your original key
or program key
um meaning that you can start the car
similarly if you have another
program key you have to program this one
as well in terms of you know you cut the
key and then you program the key to
start so they both have to to start the
car okay that''s the first step you have
to program
the key is so they start the car now
let''s say this is original so what you
do to program the remote first step
you will
just know the thing this is the the lock
button okay you''re gonna be pressing
this button you put the key into
ignition in the off position and then
you''re gonna turn it on
a position which is the the two two
lines which is which is on but not all
the way to cranking the engine okay all
right let''s start over you put the key
in
you turned it on to on position and then
you''re gonna press the log key for like
one second
okay and then you''re gonna turn to the
off position
turn it back on again within five
seconds press the lock button again
I''m gonna turn it off again I''m gonna
turn it on again you''re gonna press the
lock button for like one second I''m
gonna turn it off again I''m gonna turn
it on
now once you press this you will hear
the door cycle meaning that it entering
Remote programming mode so on this key
you''re gonna press the lock again for
one second and you should hear the lock
and unlock
and then on the additional key you can
go ahead and press the lock again
okay let''s say you press it for like one
second you should hear the law cycle
again meaning that this remote has been
programmed you have another key you go
ahead and do the same thing just
hold on to that very simple
and then you should hear the the lock
cycle again and you
get the key out of your car and then
test all of your remote and that should
be it
so essentially for this particular car
instead of you do this press button you
do this press button to entering the
programming mode you have to do this for
Cycles if that makes sense
on other models I believe you only do
this two times
one press one press and then
I''ll recycle and then you just press the
lock again blah blah blah if I can
remember but uh you know I was a little
confused at the beginning because based
on instruction
you only do this two times before
entering the programming mode anyway I
think in short you have any questions
let me know sorry I cannot do the actual
programming for you but uh also somebody
mentioned or someone if you have a on on
your key if you do have a tongue opening
you have to hold to test it you have to
hold the tongue opening for like 10
seconds
and then the trunk should open as well

so you know how to add a new key for a
car like the Honda Accord that only
requires a VCI connection but what if
all keys are lost well luckily the
process is just as simple as adding a
new key I''ll take you through the
process step by step so let''s get
started on this vehicle I will be using
the I M 608 Pro connect the cable to the
JVC then connect the other end of the
cable to the OBD2 port in the
vehicle establish a Bluetooth connection
to the JVC on your tablet these are the
only pieces of equipment you''ll need for
this process you do not need the XP 400
Pro for this car so on your tablet tap
immo and find your car we can scan the V
automatically or find your car Honda and
input it manually in this case we are
working with a Honda 2020 Accord and the
key is a smart key push to
start next we can do a system check to
make sure everything is working normally
this will do a system scan of all
modules that affect the keys and
security
the scan comes up normal so let''s select
all keys lost guided
we need to turn the ignition on and off
a few times follow the prompts on the
screen we have to make sure one original
key is in the
car is this a new model newer than 2020
yes so now we can see that a key has
been added successfully
now once it''s successful we need to
synchronize the key information with the
car we do this by turning the ignition
on and off a few times
okay so we have successfully added a key
with all keys lost now we can check to
make sure if the key works by turning
the car on or unlocking and locking the
doors so let''s do that real
quick now that we''re finished we can go
back to imemo learning and check to see
how many keys we have have we can delete
some keys add a key and check key
information my name is Mike and that''s
all for the Honda Accord the process
takes less than 5 minutes if you''re
interested in learning all about Keys
lost for Mercedes check out our other

do this
i went to the dealer and they told me
it was gonna cost like 150 dollars and
then another 150
to to um activate it to program it

i program this key that my other keys
were not gonna work
so that was a lie so he wanted me to buy
two keys
and that was gonna be like 500 bucks for
so i met some guy and he told me that if
i program this remote
the other remotes will still work so
actually have now i have three remotes
and this one works and my other two
works
still so just a little heads up on that
so if you go to the dealer they try to
make you
program the remote and program that the
other ones aren''t going to work
that''s wrong that''s not that''s not true
so um all you have to do is
the press this once and then this one
that''s it

you want your car

it tells you right there you have to
press the brake and then just press the

provide a full money back guarantee so
if it fails and you can''t get it to work
we''ll give you your money back just
reach out to us via email help
tomsky.com and we can take care of you
okay so in order to begin
you need to
turn to the dial position indicated in
the table
position number one for this honda
accord that we''re working on today we''re
going to take our working key and it''s
important to note you must have a
working key that starts the vehicle to
use our programming equipment you''ll
know which one i have working because
i''ve got this tile key finder on it you
might want to pick one of these up on
our website it pairs to your smartphone
and then you can always find your keys
in case you lose them okay to begin
we''re going to take our working key
and put it in turn two clicks to the on
position
don''t start the engine
then we''re going to take the
easy installer and plug it into the obd2
port
come down by your gas and brake pedal
look up
you''re looking for the obd2 plug like
this
just come and plug it in
you''ll hear the programmer beep so you
know it''s plugged in now i need to take
and press the button
on the end of our programmer
we heard the programmer beep
when it beeps twice you turn the
ignition off and we remove the working
key
it beeped once now we''re going to insert
our new key
and turn it to the on position don''t
start the engine
it beeped twice
that lets us know we can turn the
ignition off do not remove the key
it beeps
turn the ignition on
now wait 10 seconds we''re listening for
it to beep twice
you might notice a blinking green light
okay there it beeped twice
turn the ignition off it''ll beep again
turn the ignition on still leaving the
same new key in the ignition
and you hear the tune that let us know
it''s successful
so we''re going to turn the engine off
unplug the programmer and check that it
works
okay here we go
there we go wasn''t that easy starts the
engine
let''s check the remote buttons make sure
they work
lock
unlock
trunk and there''s the panic
okay
it''s that easy now i also want to
mention uh the instructions tell you all
about this but if early in the
programming process
the programmer beeps seven times
that means your vehicle already has the
maximum number of keys programmed to it
six keys on this on these honda vehicles
never fear the instructions
teach you how to erase
all except one working key and then you
can follow the same procedure to program
your new keys plus any additional keys
that you may have had before so there
you''ve seen just how easy it is to use
this simple key programmer to make
yourself new keys for honda vehicles go
visit tomsky.com where you can pick up
this simple key kit for your honda and
make keys and save a ton of money over
the cost that the car dealership charges
and if you''re looking for other vehicles
we probably have a kit for that as well
we look forward to helping you make new
hope you have a great day', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', 'Civic', 2016, 2016);

Hey, what''s up? How''s everybody doing?
Welcome to my channel, Mike''s
Automotive. So, today we''re working with
the Honda Civic, you guys. And this is
like 2016 and up for push to start. Now,
the customer had a auto universal remote
pro into the vehicle.
And the thing is that it was kind of
working. It turns on the car when it
wants to. It doesn''t turn on. Sometimes
it does. So, she''s like, "Hey, I''m just
going to get an OEM smart key and just
go ahead and program it." So, I said,
"All right." So, we''re going to be using
our auto. Go ahead and make sure you
have your uh emergency lights on if you
can''t turn it on. If you can turn it on,
turn it on. Okay. Now, um we''re going to
go to automatic uh VIN scan. So, it''s
going to automatically search for the
vehicle using the VIN. Um like I said,
if you can turn it on, turn it on. We''re
going to select smart key.
We''re going to do a push to start. Okay?
Because it''s push to start.
Um, as you guys can see, there''s
information right there for Civic.
Um, we''re going to We always go through
MMO status scan just because it it does
the the scan of the MMO system and it
lets us know something''s wrong with it
um or anything. So, it says is ignition
turned on by pressing the start button.
If you can turn it on, yes. If you can
press no.
So, um, we''re going to go ahead and scan
it. You guys can see it has the smart
system on here and then the immo system.
So, the smart system would be like
anything that''s keyless, any modules
that are that can pick it up, you know,
the immo system, of course, is the
immobilizer system that immobilizes a
vehicle if it''s not the correct key. So,
um, we''re going to go through all keys
lost. Actually, if you have a key, you
can go through add a key, but I''m going
to go through all keys lost because at
the end of the day, their key didn''t
want to turn on the car and off when it
needed to. And this requires you to turn
on and off the car. So, it says to place
the key to be learned in the vehicle and
take all the other keys out.
Is the ignition turned on by pressing
on? Um, no. We can''t turn it on. So,
we''re going to press no. It says press
and hold the start button. So, we''re
going to press and hold the start button
until the until the ignition uh turns on
and the cluster turns on and all the
lights, everything kind of like
accessory mode.
Um, is ignition switched on? Please
release the ignition. We''re going to
press okay.
Okay, here''s the next step. whether it''s
a newer model generally refers to after
2020. We''re going to press no because
it''s not over 2020. It''s like 16 through
18.
Now it''s establish establishing vehicle
communication.
Okay. Checking condition of the vehicle.
Please wait.
Keep program success. Would you like to
program the next one?
Press yes if you have another one. Press
no if you don''t have another one. So
it''s telling us to press the start
button.
Okay, to turn it off.
Now it says to turn it on. So basically
for all Honda, this is how it is. Turn
it off. Turn it on.
So you might have to um
Okay. Are both the keys
keyless? Is indicator immobilizer light
off? Yes, it''s off. We''re going to press
yes. Now again, it''s going to tell us to
shut it off. So, we''re going to press
it.
Now, it says to turn it on. Okay. Now,
now you''re going to have to press it
twice to turn it on every time you press
it. So, press it twice to turn it off
and once, excuse me, press it twice to
turn it on and once to turn it off. As
you guys can see, the registration is
complete. Okay, turn it off. Press it
once to turn it off. Now, don''t put your
foot on the brake, okay? Like, do not
start the actual vehicle. It just wants
you to put it in accessory mode. As you
guys can see, excuse me, it''s
programmed. The remote works. Everything
works perfectly. Um, please don''t forget

you out, subscribe to the channel. Join

is programming a smart key to a 2016 and
up Honda Civic using our Autel IM 608

because it''s down pretty low and it''s
pretty tight so just unscrew this I''ve
already kind of loosened it so this is
gonna go a lot quicker than it might for
you your first time but you really have
to push down to get this screw out so
once you''ve gotten that out drop that
out and then on this side here you''ll
notice there''s a little slot go ahead
and take a flathead screwdriver take
this large flat one from your set and
stick it in the side there and if you
kind of twist it''ll start to break apart
and break apart but there''s two pieces
to this clamshell fob and you can start
if you just kind of twist you''ll be able
to pop off the top of the key here which
was gonna be access to the battery that
we need to change so you can take your
flat-head screwdriver and just pop out
the CR 16 23 volt battery so see that go
ahead there just make sure when you put
another one back in that positive side
is down here and if you if you kind of
put in the top side first like I''m doing
here it''ll go in a lot easier okay so
once you''ve got a new one in go ahead
and just reassemble the fob and put the
two pieces back together a little snap
back together pretty easily and then go
ahead and put your little baby screw
back in and that''s it that''s how you
change key battery on a Honda Civic Bob
flatten so a little tiny Phillips one
and just screw that back in and you''re
all set and again the battery type is a
CR 16 23 volt coin battery', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', 'Civic', 2018, 2018);

going to take our working key and it''s
important to note you must have a
working key that starts the vehicle to

know which one i have working because
i''ve got this tile key finder on it you
might want to pick one of these up on
our website it pairs to your smartphone
and then you can always find your keys
in case you lose them okay to begin
we''re going to take our working key

easy installer and plug it into the obd2
port
come down by your gas and brake pedal

you''re looking for the obd2 plug like
this
just come and plug it in
you''ll hear the programmer beep so you
know it''s plugged in now i need to take
and press the button
on the end of our programmer
we heard the programmer beep
when it beeps twice you turn the
ignition off and we remove the working
key
it beeped once now we''re going to insert
our new key
and turn it to the on position don''t
start the engine
it beeped twice
that lets us know we can turn the
ignition off do not remove the key
it beeps
turn the ignition on

it to beep twice
you might notice a blinking green light
okay there it beeped twice
turn the ignition off it''ll beep again

unplug the programmer and check that it
works
okay here we go
there we go wasn''t that easy starts the
engine
let''s check the remote buttons make sure
they work
lock
unlock
trunk and there''s the panic
okay
it''s that easy now i also want to
mention uh the instructions tell you all
about this but if early in the
programming process
the programmer beeps seven times
that means your vehicle already has the
maximum number of keys programmed to it
six keys on this on these honda vehicles
never fear the instructions
teach you how to erase
all except one working key and then you
can follow the same procedure to program
your new keys plus any additional keys
that you may have had before so there
you''ve seen just how easy it is to use
this simple key programmer to make
yourself new keys for honda vehicles go
visit tomsky.com where you can pick up
this simple key kit for your honda and

the cost that the car dealership charges

Hey, what''s up? How''s everybody doing?
Welcome to my channel, Mike''s
Automotive. So, today we''re working with
the Honda Civic, you guys. And this is
like 2016 and up for push to start. Now,
the customer had a auto universal remote
pro into the vehicle.
And the thing is that it was kind of
working. It turns on the car when it
wants to. It doesn''t turn on. Sometimes
it does. So, she''s like, "Hey, I''m just
going to get an OEM smart key and just
go ahead and program it." So, I said,
"All right." So, we''re going to be using
our auto. Go ahead and make sure you
have your uh emergency lights on if you
can''t turn it on. If you can turn it on,
turn it on. Okay. Now, um we''re going to
go to automatic uh VIN scan. So, it''s
going to automatically search for the
vehicle using the VIN. Um like I said,
if you can turn it on, turn it on. We''re
going to select smart key.
We''re going to do a push to start. Okay?
Because it''s push to start.
Um, as you guys can see, there''s
information right there for Civic.
Um, we''re going to We always go through
MMO status scan just because it it does
the the scan of the MMO system and it
lets us know something''s wrong with it
um or anything. So, it says is ignition
turned on by pressing the start button.
If you can turn it on, yes. If you can
press no.
So, um, we''re going to go ahead and scan
it. You guys can see it has the smart
system on here and then the immo system.
So, the smart system would be like
anything that''s keyless, any modules
that are that can pick it up, you know,
the immo system, of course, is the
immobilizer system that immobilizes a
vehicle if it''s not the correct key. So,
um, we''re going to go through all keys
lost. Actually, if you have a key, you
can go through add a key, but I''m going
to go through all keys lost because at
the end of the day, their key didn''t
want to turn on the car and off when it
needed to. And this requires you to turn
on and off the car. So, it says to place
the key to be learned in the vehicle and
take all the other keys out.
Is the ignition turned on by pressing
on? Um, no. We can''t turn it on. So,
we''re going to press no. It says press
and hold the start button. So, we''re
going to press and hold the start button
until the until the ignition uh turns on
and the cluster turns on and all the
lights, everything kind of like
accessory mode.
Um, is ignition switched on? Please
release the ignition. We''re going to
press okay.
Okay, here''s the next step. whether it''s
a newer model generally refers to after
2020. We''re going to press no because
it''s not over 2020. It''s like 16 through
18.
Now it''s establish establishing vehicle
communication.
Okay. Checking condition of the vehicle.
Please wait.
Keep program success. Would you like to
program the next one?
Press yes if you have another one. Press
no if you don''t have another one. So
it''s telling us to press the start
button.
Okay, to turn it off.
Now it says to turn it on. So basically
for all Honda, this is how it is. Turn
it off. Turn it on.
So you might have to um
Okay. Are both the keys
keyless? Is indicator immobilizer light
off? Yes, it''s off. We''re going to press
yes. Now again, it''s going to tell us to
shut it off. So, we''re going to press
it.
Now, it says to turn it on. Okay. Now,
now you''re going to have to press it
twice to turn it on every time you press
it. So, press it twice to turn it off
and once, excuse me, press it twice to
turn it on and once to turn it off. As
you guys can see, the registration is
complete. Okay, turn it off. Press it
once to turn it off. Now, don''t put your
foot on the brake, okay? Like, do not
start the actual vehicle. It just wants
you to put it in accessory mode. As you
guys can see, excuse me, it''s
programmed. The remote works. Everything
works perfectly. Um, please don''t forget

show you how to change the key battery
for a Honda CRV this is batteries used
from 2014 to present in the physical key
so you flip the key over you can see
there''s a really small screw on the
backside of a key now to get this out
you''re gonna need a very small
screwdriver so I have a precision
screwdriver here I said also known as
kind of like a jeweler set you I got
this for four bucks you can find these
on Amazon I''ll link to it below the
video here but the real handy here
because you do need a very small
screwdriver to get this this screw out
so let me just get this out real quick
the first time you do this it can be
difficult I''ve already losing this one
so it''s gonna be pretty easy for me here
but the first time you do this you may
have to press down really hard to get to
get some traction into that screw okay
so go ahead and pop that thing off and
then if you look at the side of the key
fob there''s kind of a little notch if
you take a flathead screwdriver right
into that notch and twist I''ll give you
some some leverage to be able to pop off
the two sections of the fob and once you
get that apart and it''ll come apart
pretty easily so don''t worry about
breaking anything there as long as you
stay in the notch and kind of twist
around it''ll be good to get this part so
now you can see we have access to the
pad right in here just take our flat
head just gently pop out let''s see our
1623 volt coin battery so once you have
a new one of these just make sure the
positive side is facing down and push it
in kind of keep it towards the top here
when you first push it in because
there''s kind of some prongs down at the
bottom so let''s make it easier once
you''ve got that in make sure that you
don''t see any positive signs or
lettering facing you so you got the
right side in there and then go ahead
and reassemble the table just place
those two pieces back together and it''ll
snap together real nice and easy and
then go ahead and replace your little
little baby screw and that''s it so

the right light stay on for a while, but
it doesn''t work. Neither shut nor open

will show you a few tricks to fix it.
First, to replace Honda CRV, the key
batteries. The batteries you need is a
CR1620. The tools you need Philip
screwdrivers and a flat screwdriver. You
unscrew it.
Use the flat screwdriver gently pry
open and then use the flat screwdriver
to pry out
battery. Install the new battery.
Put it in. If it doesn''t work after you
replace battery, you need to clean it.
So, I need to take off
this, take off the rubber
boot, and then I used air duster to blow
the duster away.

And then I used the contact cleaner to
clean the three buttons related circuit.
I leave the links in the description
below if you need a contact cleaner or
air
duster. I reassembled the key for
test. After you replace battery and
clean the key, if it work,
congratulation. If you''re not, you need
to reprogram your key. Enter the
vehicle, lock all the doors, and turn
the key to the two position or on
position. And then press and hold lock
or unlock key for a few
seconds and then press another key and
hold and then press another key
again. You can also uh use the so-called
formal way. You turn the key to the on
position. Press and hold one second and
then turn to the off position. Repeat
this another two times and then you turn
to the on position. Press unlock key and
wait for the door to unlock. Test inside
the car to see the signal pairing. And
then test outside of a
car. Lock it. It''s locked. Press

replacement battery CR
2032 and I''ll put a link in the
description box of this video to where
you can find these replacement batteries
if you''re in
need so the first thing I''m going to do
is grab my key fob and remove the
emergency key that''s in the bottom of it
that''s done by pressing this release on
the back of the fob that my thumb''s on
and the key will pull out like that now
I''m going to use this key to open this
key fob case and I actually prefer to
use a flathead screwdriver it works a
little bit better but I''m going to show
you how to do it with just the key in
case that''s all you have so taking a
look at the bottom of our key fob see
these two pieces right here that kind of
look like the letter e what I''m going to
do is take my key and put it in between
those two pieces like that then I''m just
going to
pry like that and as you can see it
opens the case and I''m holding the key
fob up like this for a better camera
angle but as you do this try to keep
your buttons facing down and that will
help keep them in
place so once we get that popped off
there go ahead and pull it the rest of
the way apart with your hands like that
now we see our battery right here and
I''m going to use this key to get under
the edge of the
battery and pop it out of that holder
and again for that part Works a flathead
screwdriver does work better for that as
well but once we get our old battery out
we can grab our new battery and we want
to make sure that we''re installing our
new battery with the plus side up
positive side up and you want to tuck
that edge in
first like that and then snap it down
into place and we can snap the two
halves back
together slide our emergency key back in

the table
position number one for this honda
accord that we''re working on today we''re
going to take our working key and it''s
important to note you must have a
working key that starts the vehicle to
use our programming equipment you''ll
know which one i have working because
i''ve got this tile key finder on it you
might want to pick one of these up on
our website it pairs to your smartphone
and then you can always find your keys
in case you lose them okay to begin
we''re going to take our working key
and put it in turn two clicks to the on
position

then we''re going to take the
easy installer and plug it into the obd2
port
come down by your gas and brake pedal
look up
you''re looking for the obd2 plug like
this
just come and plug it in
you''ll hear the programmer beep so you
know it''s plugged in now i need to take
and press the button
on the end of our programmer
we heard the programmer beep
when it beeps twice you turn the
ignition off and we remove the working
key
it beeped once now we''re going to insert
our new key
and turn it to the on position don''t
start the engine
it beeped twice
that lets us know we can turn the
ignition off do not remove the key
it beeps
turn the ignition on
now wait 10 seconds we''re listening for
it to beep twice
you might notice a blinking green light
okay there it beeped twice
turn the ignition off it''ll beep again
turn the ignition on still leaving the

and you hear the tune that let us know
it''s successful
so we''re going to turn the engine off
unplug the programmer and check that it
works
okay here we go
there we go wasn''t that easy starts the
engine
let''s check the remote buttons make sure
they work
lock
unlock
trunk and there''s the panic
okay
it''s that easy now i also want to
mention uh the instructions tell you all
about this but if early in the
programming process
the programmer beeps seven times
that means your vehicle already has the
maximum number of keys programmed to it
six keys on this on these honda vehicles
never fear the instructions
teach you how to erase
all except one working key and then you
can follow the same procedure to program
your new keys plus any additional keys
that you may have had before so there
you''ve seen just how easy it is to use
this simple key programmer to make
yourself new keys for honda vehicles go
visit tomsky.com where you can pick up
this simple key kit for your honda and
make keys and save a ton of money over
the cost that the car dealership charges
and if you''re looking for other vehicles
we probably have a kit for that as well
we look forward to helping you make new

Hey, what''s up? How''s everybody doing?
Welcome to my channel, Mike''s
Automotive. So, today we''re working with
the Honda Civic, you guys. And this is
like 2016 and up for push to start. Now,
the customer had a auto universal remote
pro into the vehicle.
And the thing is that it was kind of
working. It turns on the car when it
wants to. It doesn''t turn on. Sometimes
it does. So, she''s like, "Hey, I''m just
going to get an OEM smart key and just
go ahead and program it." So, I said,
"All right." So, we''re going to be using
our auto. Go ahead and make sure you
have your uh emergency lights on if you
can''t turn it on. If you can turn it on,
turn it on. Okay. Now, um we''re going to
go to automatic uh VIN scan. So, it''s
going to automatically search for the
vehicle using the VIN. Um like I said,
if you can turn it on, turn it on. We''re
going to select smart key.
We''re going to do a push to start. Okay?
Because it''s push to start.
Um, as you guys can see, there''s
information right there for Civic.
Um, we''re going to We always go through
MMO status scan just because it it does
the the scan of the MMO system and it
lets us know something''s wrong with it
um or anything. So, it says is ignition
turned on by pressing the start button.
If you can turn it on, yes. If you can
press no.
So, um, we''re going to go ahead and scan
it. You guys can see it has the smart
system on here and then the immo system.
So, the smart system would be like
anything that''s keyless, any modules
that are that can pick it up, you know,
the immo system, of course, is the
immobilizer system that immobilizes a
vehicle if it''s not the correct key. So,
um, we''re going to go through all keys
lost. Actually, if you have a key, you
can go through add a key, but I''m going
to go through all keys lost because at
the end of the day, their key didn''t
want to turn on the car and off when it
needed to. And this requires you to turn
on and off the car. So, it says to place
the key to be learned in the vehicle and
take all the other keys out.
Is the ignition turned on by pressing
on? Um, no. We can''t turn it on. So,
we''re going to press no. It says press
and hold the start button. So, we''re
going to press and hold the start button
until the until the ignition uh turns on
and the cluster turns on and all the
lights, everything kind of like
accessory mode.
Um, is ignition switched on? Please
release the ignition. We''re going to
press okay.
Okay, here''s the next step. whether it''s
a newer model generally refers to after
2020. We''re going to press no because
it''s not over 2020. It''s like 16 through
18.
Now it''s establish establishing vehicle
communication.
Okay. Checking condition of the vehicle.
Please wait.
Keep program success. Would you like to
program the next one?
Press yes if you have another one. Press
no if you don''t have another one. So
it''s telling us to press the start
button.
Okay, to turn it off.
Now it says to turn it on. So basically
for all Honda, this is how it is. Turn
it off. Turn it on.
So you might have to um
Okay. Are both the keys
keyless? Is indicator immobilizer light
off? Yes, it''s off. We''re going to press
yes. Now again, it''s going to tell us to
shut it off. So, we''re going to press
it.
Now, it says to turn it on. Okay. Now,
now you''re going to have to press it
twice to turn it on every time you press
it. So, press it twice to turn it off
and once, excuse me, press it twice to
turn it on and once to turn it off. As
you guys can see, the registration is
complete. Okay, turn it off. Press it
once to turn it off. Now, don''t put your
foot on the brake, okay? Like, do not
start the actual vehicle. It just wants
you to put it in accessory mode. As you
guys can see, excuse me, it''s
programmed. The remote works. Everything
works perfectly. Um, please don''t forget

you out, subscribe to the channel. Join

Civic touring and for the 2022 model
year all Civics come standard with push
button start but what happens if your
key fob battery dies first let''s just
remove the battery now of course to get
inside you''ll need to take the actual
key out from the key fob but where''s the
keyhole while it''s hidden right here
behind the door handle now once you''re
inside there''s obviously no actual
Keyhole to put the physical key but
lucky for Honda owners there''s a sensor
inside the key fob that doesn''t require
batteries so you can still start your
Civic just put the key fob really close
to the engine start and stop button put
your foot on the brake and press start

what you need to do is go ahead and hit
the button like I did there you don''t
have to hit it a million times just hit
it one time and you see how it''s
flashing like that you just get the key
fob and put it right up to
it and you''ll hear a kind of a beep and
it''ll actually start to tell you to go
ahead and try to start the
car and the car will start right up okay

so I''ve taken the battery out of this

none of the buttons are working if I try
to start the vehicle as I normally would
it''s not going to
start and if I keep trying to start it
I''m going to get a message on the dash
saying to start hold remote near start
button so that''s what we''re do we''ll
take our key fob and just hold it up to
the stop start button
you''ll hear a beep and then you''ll see
this glow solid and then you''ll be able
to start the vehicle as
normal and then you''ll be able to drive
the vehicle as normal and you''ll just
need to replace the battery in the key
fob as soon as you can', 'Pending AI Analysis...', 'Gap Analysis Video', 'Automatically added via gap analysis', 'Pilot', 2017, 2017);

a spare key fob for this 2016 Honda
Civic check this out now it''s important
to know you must have one working key
fob that starts the engine so you can
use our equipment to make a spare this

got to have one key that starts the
engine because if thieves already have a

get the app downloaded once the app''s
downloaded fire it up you can go into
key pairing and it''ll walk you through
everything you need on this little
programmer device and take and scan the
QR code no one side has a QR code with
the serial number the other side has
some helpful instructions so you want to
get the serial
number there we go few important points
you need a stable internet connection
you''ve got to have all existing working
keys for your vehicle so today we''ve got
two working Keys one with this green
keychain and one with the tile keyfinder
that pairs to your smart phone so you
never lose your keys again and then

plug these in there''s an update that has
to be downloaded to the programmer it''ll
turn red if it''s doing an update

minute and we''ll let this firmware

things a paired key is required to
perform key pairing so we''ve got two
working keys today we''re only adding one

can get up to six Keys paired for you
sometimes with used vehicles you don''t
know how many lost Keys exist in the
world you might run into a limit based
on Lost keys that are with prior owner
or or lost or at a car dealership or
something all right so we got our one
key to pair let''s start turn off the

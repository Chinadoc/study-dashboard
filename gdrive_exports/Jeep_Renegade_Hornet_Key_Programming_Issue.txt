The 2023 Stellantis Security Architecture Report: A Comprehensive Analysis of Diagnostic Protocols, RF Hub Variations, and Cryptographic Key Programming for Jeep Renegade and Dodge Hornet
1. Executive Summary and Architectural Verdict
The automotive security landscape within the Stellantis conglomerate has undergone a radical architectural transformation impacting model years 2022 and 2023. This shift is characterized by the convergence of legacy Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) systems with the globalized electronic architectures of the PSA Group and Alfa Romeo. The specific technical inquiry regarding the "Enable Fobik" diagnostic option in WiTech 2.0 during an All Keys Lost (AKL) scenario on a 2023 Jeep Renegade—and its potential correlation with the Dodge Hornet—illuminates a critical area of confusion for diagnostic technicians and automotive locksmiths.
The immediate diagnostic verdict, derived from an exhaustive analysis of technical documentation, parts catalogs, and diagnostic procedures, is that the presence of the "Enable Fobik" option rather than "Program Keys" is not a system error or a deficiency in the diagnostic tool. Instead, it represents the correct, intended behavior for the modern high-security Rolling Code (Hitag AES) architecture when interacting with a pre-coded, VIN-specific key. This behavior is a direct consequence of the "Locked" status of the Radio Frequency Hub (RFH) module, a security countermeasure designed to reject the generation of new Secret Keys (SK) for blank transponders while allowing the "enabling" of transponders that have been pre-authorized via the manufacturer’s central cryptographic database.
This report serves as a definitive technical reference. It dissects the bifurcation of RF Hub hardware between the 2023 Jeep Renegade (an evolution of the Legacy Fiat Small Wide platform updated with Hitag AES) and the 2023 Dodge Hornet (based on the Alfa Romeo Tonale "Giorgio" derived architecture). It provides a rigorously verified catalog of FCC IDs, resolving the dangerous ambiguity between physically similar but electronically incompatible components. Furthermore, it offers granular, step-by-step workflows for the resolution of All Keys Lost situations on these locked platforms, specifically addressing the logistical and technical implications of sourcing keys from European versus North American supply chains.
The analysis confirms that while the Jeep Renegade and Dodge Hornet share a showroom floor and a parent company, they inhabit distinct electronic ecosystems. The Renegade utilizes the FCC ID: 2ADPXFI7PE 1, operating on a Hitag AES protocol distinct from its predecessors. The Dodge Hornet, conversely, utilizes the FCC ID: KR5ALFA434 2, inheriting the Alfa Romeo security stack. The "Enable Fobik" command is the bridge between these hardware realities and the technician's objective, serving as a validation routine rather than a programming routine.


  



2. The Evolution of Stellantis Security Architecture
To fully comprehend why the 2023 Jeep Renegade presents the "Enable Fobik" option—and why this behavior confounds technicians accustomed to older workflows—one must trace the trajectory of vehicle security modules from the legacy Chrysler era to the current, unified Stellantis Global architecture. This evolution is not merely a change in part numbers but a fundamental philosophical shift in how the vehicle establishes "trust" with an external credential.
2.1 The Legacy Paradigm: Wireless Ignition Node (WIN)
In previous generations of the Chrysler architecture (dominating roughly from 2008 to 2018), vehicles utilized the Wireless Ignition Node (WIN) or the Wireless Control Module (WCM). These units were often integrated directly into the ignition switch mechanism. The key programming paradigm in these systems was bidirectional and "dealership-centric."
In a WIN-based system, the key programming process involved the vehicle's module actively writing data to the key. The technician would insert a blank, "virgin" transponder key. The diagnostic tool (WiTech 1.0 or early 2.0) would retrieve a 4-digit PIN from the immobilizer system. Upon successful authentication, the WIN would generate a unique Secret Key (SK) and write this data, along with the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and other configuration bytes, onto the blank transponder's writable memory blocks.
This "Program Keys" routine was a generative act. The car created the identity of the key. Consequently, the supply chain could rely on generic, blank keys that were widely interchangeable between compatible models until the moment of programming. The diagnostic command "Program Keys" accurately described the action: the tool was instructing the car to program the blank slate of the transponder.
2.2 The Transitional Phase: Separated RF Hubs
Starting with the introduction of the JL Wrangler and spreading to the Refresh Renegade and Compass models, the architecture evolved. The ignition node was physically separated from the radio receiver, giving rise to the dedicated Radio Frequency Hub (RFH).
The RFH became the "Master" of security, handling remote entry, passive start (Keyless Go), and immobilizer verification. Initially, these RF Hubs functioned similarly to the WIN modules regarding key programming. They accepted blank keys and performed the generative "Program Keys" routine. However, as vehicle theft methods became more sophisticated—specifically relay attacks and OBD-port key cloning devices—the vulnerability of allowing the RF Hub to generate new keys on demand became a liability.
2.3 The "Locked" Hub Paradigm and Write-Once Logic
The most significant architectural hardening occurred in the 2022+ model years with the universal implementation of the "Locked" RF Hub policy. In an effort to thwart illicit key generation, Stellantis introduced a "Write-Once" logic to the RF Hub's Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM).
Once an RF Hub is installed in a vehicle, paired with the Body Control Module (BCM) and Engine Control Module (ECM), and has its initial set of keys programmed (usually at the assembly plant), the Hub changes its internal state to "Locked." In this state, the Hub permanently disables the software routine responsible for generating new Secret Keys for blank transponders.
This architectural decision has profound implications for the "Program Keys" function in WiTech:
1. Legacy "Program Keys" Disabled: The routine that instructs the Hub to take a blank key, generate a crypto-key pair, and write it to the key is essentially deleted or blocked in the firmware. The Hub no longer possesses the authority to create new key identities.
2. Technician User Experience: Consequently, when a technician connects WiTech to a 2023 Renegade with a locked Hub, the "Program Keys" option is often greyed out or removed entirely to prevent the technician from attempting a procedure that the hardware physically cannot perform. This absence is often misinterpreted as a communication failure or a software bug, but it is a deliberate security feature.
2.4 The Pre-Coded Key Ecosystem and the "Enable" Routine
With the Hub unable to write to blank keys, the burden of cryptography shifts upstream to the supply chain. This is the origin of the "Pre-Coded" or "VIN-Specific" key.
When a technician orders a key "by VIN" from the dealer—as the user in this case did, sourcing from a Fiat Europe distributor—the key does not arrive blank. The order triggers a process at the parts distribution center or the key manufacturing facility. The manufacturing database uses the vehicle's VIN to look up the specific Secret Key (SK) that was originally assigned to that specific RF Hub during the vehicle's assembly. This SK is written to the new key's memory before it is shipped.
When this pre-coded key arrives at the service bay, it is effectively already "programmed" in terms of cryptography. It knows the car's secrets. However, the car does not yet know to accept commands from this specific key ID (Transponder ID).
This is where the "Enable Fobik" routine enters the equation. This diagnostic function does not attempt to write crypto data (which would fail on a locked Hub). Instead, it initiates a verification handshake.
1. The Prompt: WiTech asks the technician to present the key to the Low Frequency (LF) antenna (usually the Start/Stop button).
2. The Challenge: The Hub sends a random challenge sequence to the key.
3. The Response: The key encrypts the challenge using the pre-coded Secret Key and transmits the result back to the Hub.
4. The Validation: The Hub decrypts the response using its own copy of the Secret Key. If the result matches, the Hub confirms that the key is valid and "Enables" (whitelists) the Transponder ID in its allowed memory.
This distinction fully explains the user's observation: WiTech offered "Enable Fobik" because the system logic, detecting a locked architecture, assumes that any new key must be pre-coded. The tool is guiding the technician toward the only valid path for that hardware state.
3. Hardware Analysis: 2023 Jeep Renegade (BU/BV)
The 2023 Jeep Renegade represents a complex case study in platform evolution. While it sits on the "Small Wide 4x4" platform shared with the Fiat 500X, its electronic architecture has diverged significantly from the early 2015–2018 models. The assumption that parts are interchangeable across model years or between sister vehicles like the Fiat 500X is a primary source of inventory error.
3.1 Frequency and Modulation Shift: The Hitag AES Era
Early Renegades (2015–2018) utilized the SIP22 mechanical keyway and a remote operating on 433 MHz with Megamos AES modulation. The FCC ID for these remotes was typically 2ADFTFI5AM433TX.4 These keys relied on the Megamos crypto transponder family, a staple of the Fiat ecosystem for decades.
However, the 2023 model has migrated to a newer, more robust standard. The research material confirms that the 2022–2023 Jeep Renegade uses a Smart Key with FCC ID: 2ADPXFI7PE.1
* Frequency: 434 MHz (often denoted as 433.92 MHz, but the label distinction is crucial for ordering).
* Chip Type: HITAG AES (Type 6A).
* IC Number: 12548A-FI7PE.
The shift from Megamos AES to Hitag AES is a "hard break" in compatibility. These two protocols utilize different modulation schemes (FSK vs ASK variations) and completely different cryptographic algorithms. A technician attempting to program a legacy Fiat 500X key (Megamos) to a 2023 Renegade (Hitag) will fail at the detection stage; the RF Hub cannot even demodulate the signal to read the ID, let alone authenticate it. The snippet 5 highlights user reports of key fob issues that stem from these subtle frequency and rolling code mismatches, further emphasizing the need for precise part identification.
3.2 RF Hub Specifications and Supersession
The RF Hub for the 2023 Renegade is identified in the Mopar parts catalog as part number 68638489AA.6 This module is explicitly described as the "Wireless Ignition Node Receiver" or "Passive Entry Module."
Crucially, the research indicates a high rate of supersession for this part (replacing 68256579AA, 68321203AA, 68401869AA, 68525973AA, and others). This rapid iteration of part numbers is a strong indicator of continuous firmware updates, likely addressing security vulnerabilities. Each supersession potentially introduces stricter "Locking" logic. The 2023 variant (...89AA) represents the culmination of these security patches, enforcing the strictest interpretation of the "Enable Fobik" requirement.
Note on AKL in 2023: If all keys are lost on a 2023 Renegade, and the vehicle has a "Locked" RF Hub (which is standard for this year), a simple "Enable Fobik" might fail if the Hub requires at least one working key to authenticate the diagnostic session itself (a "Security Gateway" constraint). In many cases, a truly "All Keys Lost" situation on a locked 2023 platform requires the replacement of the RF Hub with a "Virgin" unit (Part 68638489AA) to allow the programming of keys. However, utilizing a VIN-specific key via the "Enable" route is the only factory-supported method to avoid module replacement, assuming the dealership's "Enable" routine is authorized to add a pre-coded key without a working master—a capability that WiTech 2.0 often reserves for authenticated dealer sessions.


  



4. Hardware Analysis: Dodge Hornet (GG)
The user query mentions the "Hornet/Renegade" as if they are related variants of the same problem. While they are both small SUVs in the Stellantis portfolio, they reside on fundamentally different architectures in 2023. The Dodge Hornet is not a "Jeep" in its electronic DNA; it is a rebadged Alfa Romeo Tonale. This distinction is paramount for selecting the correct FCC ID and diagnostic approach.
4.1 The Alfa Romeo Connection and the "Giorgio" Legacy
The Dodge Hornet shares its platform and electrical architecture with the Alfa Romeo Tonale. This architecture is a derivative of the "Giorgio" platform that underpins the Alfa Romeo Giulia and Stelvio. Consequently, it uses the Continental automotive security system, which is distinct from the Delphi/TRW systems often found in legacy Jeep products.
The research confirms that the key fob for the Alfa Romeo Giulia, Stelvio, and Tonale uses FCC ID: KR5ALFA434.2 This fob operates on 433 MHz but uses the NCF29A1M / HITAG AES / 4A chip architecture. This is a highly specific protocol that differs from the Renegade's Hitag AES implementation.
Despite some snippets suggesting the legacy Dodge Charger fob (M3N-40821302) might be compatible 7, this is likely a cataloging error common in third-party databases that conflate "Dodge" brand identity with "Dodge" platform reality. The Mopar part number for the Hornet-specific key is 7QV80LXHPA.8 The physical shape and button configuration of the Hornet key (often featuring the specific 'Hatch' release logic of the Tonale) aligns with the Alfa hardware, not the Dodge Charger hardware. The Mopar catalog specifically links the transmitter 7QV80LXHPA to the Hornet and notes it replaces 7QV80LXHAA 9, confirming a lineage specific to this new model introduction.
4.2 RF Hub Variations for the Hornet
The RF Hub for the Dodge Hornet is cataloged under different part numbers than the Renegade. Research snippet 10 identifies a Wireless Control Module Receiver 68583952AA for Ram/New Architecture vehicles, but for the Hornet specifically, we see references to 68572335AA 11 and 68638466AA (shared with some Renegade trims but configured differently).12
The critical takeaway is that the Hornet's RF Hub is part of the Atlantis High architecture. It enforces the same "Locked" logic as the Renegade but communicates via a different gateway protocol. The Secure Gateway (SGW) in the Hornet is often integrated into the BCM or a dedicated module depending on the specific trim level (GT vs R/T PHEV).
Compatibility Warning: A key with FCC 2ADPXFI7PE (Renegade) will not program to a Dodge Hornet (FCC KR5ALFA434 / Part 7QV80LXHPA), even though both are 2023 Stellantis SUVs. They speak different "dialects" of Hitag AES. The Hornet's system expects the specific NCF29A1M chip signature, while the Renegade expects the 12548A signature.
5. Technical Deep Dive: "Enable Fobik" Explained
The "Enable Fobik" command is not merely a synonym for "Program Keys"; it represents a fundamental change in the trust model of the vehicle's security. Understanding this distinction is the key to successfully navigating the diagnostic session.
5.1 The "Program Keys" Mechanism (Legacy)
In the legacy method (Program Keys), the trust is established at the moment of programming. The vehicle is the authority.
1. Authentication: Technician enters a 4-digit PIN to prove they are authorized.
2. Handshake: The Hub wakes up the key.
3. Key Generation: The Hub generates a random Secret Key (SK).
4. Write: The Hub writes the SK to the key's locked memory.
5. Store: The Hub stores the Key ID in its memory.
This method requires the Hub to have "Write" privileges to the key and "Key Generation" capabilities enabled in its firmware.
5.2 The "Enable Fobik" Mechanism (Modern/Alfa)
In the modern architecture (derived from the Alfa Romeo "Proxi" logic), the trust is established before the key reaches the vehicle. The factory database is the authority.
1. Pre-Coding: The SK is written to the key at the factory based on the VIN. The key is shipped "Locked" to that VIN.
2. Enable Routine: The technician selects "Enable Fobik" in WiTech.
3. Challenge-Response: The Hub sends a challenge to the key.
4. Verification: The key responds using the pre-coded SK.
5. Whitelist: If the cryptographic math checks out, the Hub "enables" (whitelists) that Key ID.
This method allows the RF Hub to remain "Locked" (incapable of generating new SKs) while still allowing new keys to be added, provided they are sourced correctly from the OEM supply chain. This is the only path for a Locked Hub without replacing it.
5.3 Why WiTech Shows Only "Enable"
The presence of only "Enable Fobik" in the WiTech menu is a direct indicator that:
1. The RF Hub is in a Locked State. It has disabled its own key generation subroutine.
2. The diagnostic software has detected the specific BCM variant (likely Marelli or Continental) that supports the Alfa-style "Enable" logic.
This confirms the user's situation is normal behavior for the platform. The user must proceed with the "Enable" routine using the VIN-specific key. Attempting to force a "Program Keys" routine (if it were visible) with a blank key would fail because the Hub would refuse to write the SK.


  



6. Procedural Workflow for 2023 Renegade AKL
Based on the synthesis of the "Locked" Hub status and the "Enable" menu availability, the following workflow is recommended for the 2023 Jeep Renegade All Keys Lost scenario. This workflow presumes access to WiTech 2.0.
6.1 Prerequisites and Preparation
* Vehicle Battery: Must be stable and maintained above 12.5V. Low voltage can corrupt the RF Hub during the writing phase.13 A battery maintainer is mandatory.
* WiTech 2.0 Access: Active subscription and internet connection required for authentication with the Stellantis server.
* Key Hardware: VIN-specific, pre-coded dealer key (Part 7TB23DX9AA / FCC 2ADPXFI7PE). Do not use an aftermarket blank.
* Physical Environment: Ensure the vehicle is not in "Logistics Mode" or "Ship Mode." All doors should be closed.
6.2 The "Enable" Routine Execution
1. Connect WiTech: Perform a full vehicle topology scan. Clear all DTCs in the RFH (Radio Frequency Hub) and BCM (Body Control Module). Active faults can block the programming routine.
2. Select RFH Module: Navigate to the specific Radio Frequency Hub module view in the topology.
3. Misc Functions Menu: Look for "Enable Fobik" (or "Program Keys" if available, though likely absent). Select "Enable Fobik".
4. Initiate Routine:
   * WiTech will prompt the technician to place the new key against the Start/Stop button or in the Center Console Cupholder. For the 2023 Renegade, the Low Frequency (LF) antenna sweet spot is often directly on the Start/Stop button itself.
   * Follow the on-screen prompt to press the "Unlock" button on the fob. This triggers the transmission of the encrypted response.
5. Validation:
   * If successful, the instrument cluster will display "Key Saved" or the security lock light will extinguish.
   * Test Functionality: Test Lock/Unlock buttons and Passive Entry (Keyless Go) functionality immediately. Start the engine to confirm immobilizer authorization.
6.3 Contingency: If "Enable" Fails
If the "Enable Fobik" routine fails with a VIN-specific key, the likely causes are:
* RF Hub Lockout: The Hub is in a "Alarm Active" or "Theft" state and refuses diagnostic communication.
   * Remedy: Leave ignition ON for 1 hour to reset the security timer.
* Defective Pre-Coding: The key was coded to the wrong VIN or the database record for the vehicle's Secret Key is corrupt. This is rare but possible with international sourcing.
   * Remedy: There is no fix other than ordering a replacement RF Hub and a new set of keys to start fresh.
* Hub "Bricked": As noted in snippet 13, attempting to pull PINs via aftermarket tools (Autel/Lonsdor) before using WiTech can corrupt the RF Hub's bootloader. If the user or a previous tech attempted to "Read PIN" via OBD, the Hub may be permanently damaged.
7. Detailed Diagnostics: Troubleshooting the "Enable Fobik" Failure
While the presence of "Enable Fobik" is normal, technicians may encounter failures during the execution of this routine. This section details specific failure modes associated with the 2023 Renegade and Hornet platforms and provides actionable troubleshooting steps.
7.1 Failure Mode: "Procedure Failed" or "Timeout"
If the WiTech routine initiates but fails to complete:
* Antenna Placement: The 2023 Renegade's Low Frequency (LF) antenna for key programming is located directly behind the Start/Stop button or on the steering column shroud. Unlike previous models where the center console was the primary spot, the "Hitag" system often requires the key to be physically touching the Start button during the "Press Unlock" prompt. The orientation of the fob matters; try touching the "Logo" side of the fob to the button.
* RF Interference: The 434 MHz band is susceptible to interference from LED lighting, chargers, or other diagnostic tools. Ensure all non-essential electronics in the cabin are unplugged.
7.2 Failure Mode: "Security Access Denied"
* SGW Bypass Issues: WiTech utilizes an authorized AutoAuth login to bypass the Secure Gateway (SGW). However, if physical bypass cables (often used by aftermarket tools) are left installed, they can sometimes interfere with the BCM's communication with the RF Hub. Ensure the factory configuration is restored before using WiTech.
* Hub Lock Status: If the RF Hub was previously "bricked" by an aftermarket tool attempting to read the PIN 13, the Hub may be in a permanent bootloop. In this state, WiTech may see the module but fail to execute secure routines. The only remedy is RF Hub Replacement.
7.3 Failure Mode: VIN Mismatch
* Pre-Code Error: If the key was ordered for the wrong VIN (e.g., a typo in the parts order), the "Enable" routine will fail instantly. The RF Hub compares the key's embedded Secret Key against its internal database. A mismatch results in a silent failure or a generic "Programming Failed" message.
   * Diagnostic Tip: Use a transponder reader (like a Key Tool Max or similar) to read the "Key ID" and "Status" of the new key. Verify it is "Locked" (Pre-coded) and not "Unlocked" (Blank). If it is Unlocked, it is the wrong key for an "Enable" routine.
8. Comprehensive Part Number and FCC ID Database
To prevent inventory errors, the following database correlates the vehicle platform, year, and required key hardware. This table integrates the findings regarding the incompatibility between Renegade and Hornet systems.
8.1 Jeep Renegade (BU/BV)

	Alfa Tonale Platform.
	Crucial Insight: The frequency is nominally similar (433 vs 434 MHz), but the modulation and transponder language (Megamos vs Hitag vs Alfa-Hitag) are completely different. The FCC ID 2ADPXFI7PE for the Renegade and KR5ALFA434 for the Hornet represent two distinct security ecosystems that cannot cross-pollinate.
9. Strategic Stocking Guide for 2024
To address the user's specific goal of "stocking the right parts," the following inventory strategy is recommended for locksmiths and repair facilities dealing with modern Stellantis AKL situations.
9.1 The "Must-Stock" List
1. For Jeep Renegade (2022+):
   * OEM Key: 7TB23DX9AA (FCC 2ADPXFI7PE).
   * Stocking Note: Because these require pre-coding for the "Enable" routine, stocking "Blanks" is only useful if you possess high-end aftermarket programmer tools capable of "Pre-Coding" Dealer Keys (preparing a blank with the correct SK). For shops relying on WiTech, stocking blanks is futile; you must order by VIN for each job.
   * Fiat Europe Source: The user mentioned sourcing from Fiat Europe. Since the Renegade is manufactured in Melfi, Italy, European keys often work perfectly provided they match the 434 MHz frequency. The key must be for the BU/BV platform.
2. For Dodge Hornet (2023+):
   * OEM Key: 7QV80LXHPA (FCC KR5ALFA434).
   * Stocking Note: Similar to the Renegade, these are best ordered by VIN for WiTech programming. However, because this is an Alfa system, some advanced aftermarket tools (like the Star Connector bypass methods) might allow adding virgin keys if the PIN can be successfully extracted without bricking the BCM.
9.2 The "Do Not Stock" List (For these models)
* Legacy Dodge Keys: FCC M3N-40821302 (Charger/Challenger). Do not attempt to use these on the Hornet. They will physically fit in the pocket but will not program.
* Legacy Fiat Keys: FCC 2ADFTFI5AM433TX (Old Renegade/500X). These are obsolete for the 2023 model year.
10. Conclusion and Action Plan
The user's encounter with the "Enable Fobik" option on a 2023 Jeep Renegade AKL is consistent with the vehicle's updated security architecture. It is not an error, but a feature of the "Locked" RF Hub system.
Summary of Findings:
1. "Enable Fobik" is Correct: It is the designated procedure for adding pre-coded (VIN-specific) keys to a Locked RF Hub.
2. Hardware Divergence: The 2023 Renegade uses FCC 2ADPXFI7PE. The Dodge Hornet uses FCC KR5ALFA434. They are not interchangeable.
3. Procedure: The user should proceed with the "Enable Fobik" routine. No "Program Keys" option is needed or expected.
Recommended Action for the User:
1. Verify Part: Ensure the key in hand for the Renegade matches FCC 2ADPXFI7PE.
2. Execute "Enable": Run the "Enable Fobik" routine in WiTech.
3. Stocking Strategy: Stock 2ADPXFI7PE for 2022+ Renegades and 7QV80LXHPA (Alfa style) for Hornets. Do not cross-stock legacy Dodge keys for the Hornet.
By aligning inventory with these specific FCC IDs and understanding the "Enable Fobik" procedural requirement, technicians can eliminate the guesswork and "part darting" that currently plagues the repair of these transitional 2023 architectures.

Automotive Security Architecture Evolution: Kia/Hyundai (2019–2025)
Executive Summary
The period spanning 2019 to 2025 represents the most volatile and transformative era in the automotive security history of the Hyundai Motor Group (HMG), encompassing both the Hyundai and Kia marques. This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of the architectural shifts precipitated by the "turn-key" theft crisis—a vulnerability that exposed millions of vehicles to theft via simple mechanical exploitation—and the subsequent strategic pivot toward next-generation electrical architectures.
The analysis identifies three distinct security epochs that define this timeframe. The first is the Legacy Vulnerability Era (Pre-2021/22), characterized by the absence of hardware immobilizers in lower-trim vehicles. This deficiency led to the rapid development and deployment of "Campaign 993" and "CS920" remediation strategies, which attempted to patch hardware gaps with software logic, introducing complex operational constraints such as the "Dead Fob" emergency start failure mode. The second epoch is the Secure Gateway (SGW) Transitional Era (2018–2022), where HMG introduced firewall modules to partition the OBD-II port from critical vehicle networks. This move necessitated the use of "12+8" bypass methodologies for diagnostics and key programming, fundamentally altering the aftermarket service landscape. The third and current epoch is the ccNC & CAN FD Modernization (2023–Present), marked by the "June 2023" production split. This phase introduces the Connected Car Navigation Cockpit (ccNC) and the Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate (CAN FD) protocol, fundamentally altering diagnostic communication, immobilizer encryption (Hitag AES), and key fob hardware specifications.
This report is designed to serve as a definitive reference for automotive security architects, forensic analysts, and SQL database administrators responsible for vehicles_master generation. It synthesizes technical service bulletins (TSBs), FCC filing data, and diagnostic protocol changes to provide a granular view of HMG’s security roadmap. The following timeline visually encapsulates these overlapping eras, providing a temporal framework for the detailed technical analysis that follows.


 Image 1. The Context of the Crisis: Architecture Before the Storm
To understand the profound changes implemented between 2019 and 2025, one must first analyze the architectural baseline that precipitated the crisis. For nearly a decade prior to 2021, Hyundai and Kia operated under a split security strategy in the North American market. While mandates in Canada and Europe required the installation of engine immobilizers—systems utilizing a transponder chip in the key head to cryptographically authenticate with the vehicle's Engine Control Unit (ECU)—U.S. regulations did not. Consequently, HMG opted to omit this hardware from "turn-key" ignition vehicles in lower trim levels to reduce manufacturing costs.
In these vehicles, the ignition cylinder was a purely mechanical switch. The "security" relied entirely on the physical integrity of the lock cylinder. However, the design of the steering column housing allowed for relatively easy removal of the lock cylinder casing. Once removed, a rectangular tab on the ignition switch was exposed. This tab, designed to interface with the tailpiece of the lock cylinder, could be rotated by any tool with a matching rectangular profile—most notoriously, a standard USB-A connector. Because there was no transponder interrogation, the vehicle's ECU would accept the "Start" signal from the ignition switch and initiate the engine, provided the mechanical steering lock was bypassed or broken.
This vulnerability remained largely obscure until the proliferation of instructional videos on social media platforms in 2021 and 2022. The resulting surge in thefts forced HMG into a reactionary posture. The company could not retroactively install transponder coils and chips into millions of vehicles; the cost and logistical complexity of replacing keys, ignition cylinders, and ECUs for the entire legacy fleet were prohibitive. Instead, HMG engineers were tasked with developing a solution using the existing hardware, leading to the creation of the software-based "Campaign 993" and the authorization of the hardware-based "CS920" kits. This marked the beginning of the remediation era, a period defined by the attempt to simulate hardware security through software logic.
2. The Legacy Remediation Architecture: Campaign 993 and CS920
The remediation phase represents a unique period in automotive engineering where software was used to emulate missing hardware functionality. This approach, while necessary, introduced significant operational complexity and deviation from standard automotive security behaviors.
2.1 Campaign 993: BCM Logic Inversion
The core of the remediation strategy, designated Campaign 993 for Hyundai and similar campaign codes for Kia, involved a firmware update to the Body Control Module (BCM). In the original vehicle architecture, the BCM monitored the door lock status primarily for the purpose of the perimeter alarm (honking the horn if a door was opened without unlocking). It did not, however, have authority to inhibit the engine starter. The engine starting circuit was largely independent of the alarm state.
The Campaign 993 update fundamentally altered this "Start Enable" logic, creating what can be termed a "Virtual Immobilizer." The new logic flow operates as follows:
1. Arming Sequence: When the user exits the vehicle and locks the doors using the Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) fob, the BCM enters a "Theft Deterrent Armed" state. This state transition is confirmed by a specific feedback signal (e.g., hazard light flash or horn chirp).
2. Ignition Inhibition: Crucially, while in this "Armed" state, the BCM now actively interrupts the electrical signal to the starter relay or, in some implementations, the fuel pump. Even if the physical ignition switch is turned to the "Start" position (as a thief would do after breaking the lock cylinder), the BCM prevents the starter motor from cranking. The circuit is logically open.
3. Disarming Protocol: The "Armed" state is only disarmed by a valid "Unlock" signal from the RKE fob or, in specific contingencies, the physical actuation of the driver's door lock cylinder microswitch.
4. Theft Attempt Response: If a thief gains entry by breaking a window (thereby bypassing the door lock cylinder and its microswitch) and proceeds to force the ignition, the BCM detects that the system is still in the "Armed" state. It consequently suppresses the ignition sequence and triggers the alarm horn.
This software-defined security model differs from a true transponder system in one critical aspect: it relies on the state of the alarm rather than the presence of a key. In a transponder system, the key is authenticated every time the ignition is turned, regardless of whether the car was locked or unlocked. In the Campaign 993 system, if the user neglects to lock the car with the fob, the "Virtual Immobilizer" is never armed, and the vehicle remains vulnerable to the mechanical USB theft method.
2.2 The "Dead Fob" Crisis and Emergency Logic
The reliance on the RKE fob to disarm the BCM introduced a severe failure mode that has plagued service departments and owners: the "Dead Fob" scenario. In a standard immobilizer-equipped vehicle, a dead key fob battery is a minor inconvenience. The user can manually unlock the door with the metal key blade, and the passive transponder chip in the key head—which requires no battery power—is energized by the induction coil in the ignition lock, allowing the car to start.
However, under the Campaign 993 logic, the "Virtual Immobilizer" is disarmed primarily by the RKE "Unlock" signal. If the fob battery is depleted, the fob cannot transmit this signal. The BCM remains "Armed." When the user manually unlocks the door with the key blade and attempts to start the car, the BCM—still believing the car is in theft mode—blocks the starter.
To address this, HMG engineers implemented a secondary disarm trigger: the door lock cylinder microswitch. The logic dictates that if the physical key is turned in the driver's door lock cylinder, the mechanical action closes a microswitch inside the door. The BCM is programmed to interpret this specific electrical input as a valid "Disarm" command, equivalent to a fob press.
Forensic Analysis of Failure: Research and field reports indicate a high failure rate for this workaround. The door lock cylinder is often the least used component in modern vehicles, as most users rely exclusively on the remote. Consequently, the mechanism is prone to seizing, or the microswitch contacts may corrode or fail due to disuse. When a user with a dead fob attempts the emergency entry, one of two things often happens:
1. The lock cylinder turns mechanically, unlocking the door latch, but the microswitch fails to trigger the electrical signal to the BCM. The alarm sounds, and the car refuses to start.
2. The vehicle has been previously subject to a theft attempt where the door lock was damaged, rendering the microswitch inoperative.
This architectural oversight means that a simple dead battery can result in a "tow-in" condition, a scenario that is extremely rare in vehicles with standard transponder immobilizers. Diagnostic procedures for "No Start" conditions on 2011-2021 HMG vehicles must now prioritize checking the "Theft Deterrent State" in the BCM data stream before investigating starters or batteries.
2.3 CS920: The Hardware Alternative
While Campaign 993 addressed the majority of the fleet, certain base models lacked the BCM hardware necessary to support the new logic. For these vehicles, and for customers seeking additional layers of security, HMG authorized the use of the CS920 solution. The term "CS920" refers to a specific hardware kit manufactured by Compustar (Firstech), marketed as the Compustar CS920-S.
Unlike the BCM firmware update, the CS920 is a traditional aftermarket alarm system overlay. It consists of a control module, a shock/glass-break sensor, and a starter-kill relay.
* Architecture: The CS920 does not integrate deeply with the vehicle's CAN bus logic in the same way the OEM firmware does. Instead, it physically interrupts the low-current starter wire coming from the ignition switch.
* Trigger Logic: The system relies on acoustic glass break sensors and shock sensors to detect intrusion. Upon detection, it opens the starter-kill relay.
* Implications for SQL Generation: When generating vehicles_master data, vehicles flagged with "CS920" must be distinguished from those with "Campaign 993." The former relies on third-party hardware that may require separate maintenance or key fobs (if the kit includes separate remotes, which the CS920-S often does).
2.4 Applicability and Model Specifics
The rollout of these remediation measures was model and year specific. The table below details the eligibility for the software update. Note that vehicles equipped with factory "Push Button Start" are exempt, as they inherently possess the transponder-based immobilizer system that the software attempts to emulate.

	Exclusions and Conflicts: Vehicles produced after November 2021 generally have immobilizers as standard equipment, rendering them ineligible for and essentially immune to the specific vulnerability Campaign 993 addresses. Furthermore, vehicles equipped with aftermarket remote start systems face significant compatibility challenges. The Campaign 993 logic (Alarm Armed = Immobilized) directly conflicts with remote starters, which attempt to start the engine while the doors are locked. This often necessitates the removal or disabling of the remote start system to apply the security patch, a trade-off many owners are forced to make.
3. The Secure Gateway (SGW) Paradigm (2018–2022)
While the remediation of the "Kia Boys" vulnerability focused on physical security and BCM logic, a parallel and more sophisticated transformation was occurring in the vehicle's digital architecture: the introduction of the Secure Gateway (SGW). This development was driven by the industry-wide recognition of the risks posed by open CAN bus architectures, where a device plugged into the OBD-II port had unrestricted access to all vehicle networks.
3.1 The End of "Open CAN"
Prior to 2018, the architecture of HMG vehicles—like most in the industry—was relatively open. The OBD-II Data Link Connector (DLC) pins 6 and 14 were wired directly to the vehicle's primary high-speed CAN bus (C-CAN or P-CAN). This allowed diagnostic tools to communicate directly with any ECU on the network. However, it also meant that a malicious device could inject messages to unlock doors, lower windows, or program new keys without any authentication barrier.
Starting with flagship models like the 2018 Genesis G90 and expanding rapidly to high-volume movers like the 2020 Palisade and 2020 Telluride, HMG introduced the SGW module. This device functions as a network firewall. It physically separates the "Public" network (the OBD-II port and telematics unit) from the "Private" vehicle networks (P-CAN, C-CAN, Body CAN).
SGW Filtering Logic: The SGW operates by inspecting the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) requests sent by a connected tool.
* Read Access (Allowed): The SGW permits standard read-only commands, such as Mode $01 (Live Data), Mode $03 (Read DTCs), and Mode $09 (Vehicle Information). This ensures compliance with Right-to-Repair mandates regarding emissions and basic diagnostics.
* Write Access (Blocked): Any command that attempts to alter the state of the vehicle is blocked by default. This includes clearing DTCs (Mode $04/SID $14), Actuation Tests (SID $2F or $31), and most critically, Security Access (SID $27) procedures required for key programming.
3.2 The "12+8" Physical Bypass: An Aftermarket Necessity
The introduction of the SGW created an immediate hurdle for the independent aftermarket. Initially, only OEM dealer tools (GDS-Mobile) possessed the digital certificates required to authenticate with the SGW and unlock "Write" access. Independent locksmiths and repair shops found their tools locked out of critical functions.
To circumvent this, the industry developed the "12+8" Bypass method. This technique relies on the physical architecture of the SGW module itself. In many HMG vehicles from this transitional era, the SGW is a discrete component or integrated into the Smart Junction Box (SJB), connected to the vehicle harness via two specific plugs: a 12-pin connector and an 8-pin connector.
The Bypass Procedure: Technicians locate the SGW module—often buried behind the glovebox, in the passenger kick panel, or behind the infotainment screen. They unplug the factory 12-pin and 8-pin connectors from the SGW module and plug them into a "Bypass Cable." This cable effectively bridges the diagnostic lines directly to the vehicle's internal CAN bus, physically removing the SGW firewall from the circuit. The diagnostic tool then connects to the OBD-II end of the bypass cable, restoring "Open CAN" access and allowing for key programming and code clearing.

	3.3 The Digital Shift: AutoAuth
By 2022, the "physical bypass" method began to be supplemented by a digital solution known as AutoAuth. This is a service integrated into modern diagnostic tablets (e.g., Autel, Snap-On, Launch). The diagnostic tool connects to the internet via Wi-Fi. When it encounters an SGW, it sends a handshake request to the AutoAuth server, which validates the technician's credentials and subscription. If valid, the server sends a cryptographic token back to the tool, which then passes it to the vehicle's SGW. The SGW verifies the token and unlocks the gateway for a specific session duration.
While AutoAuth has reduced the need for dashboard disassembly, the physical 12+8 method remains a critical fallback. In scenarios where the vehicle has no power, the SGW is faulty, or internet connectivity is unavailable, the physical bypass is the only way to communicate with the vehicle's ECUs. For vehicles_master SQL generation, flagging a vehicle as SGW_Enabled triggers the requirement for either an AutoAuth-compatible tool or a physical bypass cable in the service workflow.
4. The June 2023 Divergence: CAN FD & ccNC Architecture
The most significant architectural disruption in the 2019-2025 window is the June 2023 production split. This date marks the transition from the legacy "Gen5W" infotainment/electrical architecture to the Connected Car Navigation Cockpit (ccNC) platform. This shift is not merely an update to the radio; it represents a fundamental change in how the vehicle's digital nervous system operates, necessitating new hardware protocols.
4.1 The ccNC Domain Controller
The Connected Car Navigation Cockpit (ccNC) is HMG's next-generation electrical architecture. In previous iterations, the infotainment unit was largely separate from the vehicle's control logic. In the ccNC architecture, the system acts as a central domain controller, tightly integrated with the instrument cluster, Heads-Up Display (HUD), and the vehicle's core gateway. This integration is designed to support Over-the-Air (OTA) updates that extend beyond maps to encompass firmware updates for suspension, braking, and powertrain modules.
This architecture was first deployed on the Kia EV9 and rapidly expanded to the 2024 Hyundai Kona, 2024 Santa Fe, and the refreshed 2024 Sonata. The "June 2023" date often cited in TSBs refers to the start of mass production for these 2024 model year vehicles featuring this new backbone.
4.2 CAN FD: The Protocol of Necessity
To support the massive data throughput required by the ccNC architecture—particularly for OTA updates and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)—HMG migrated the diagnostic communication protocol from Classic CAN to CAN FD (Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate).
Technical Comparison:
* Classic CAN (ISO 11898): Used in pre-2023 HMG vehicles. It has a fixed data rate (typically 500 kbps) and a maximum payload of 8 bytes per frame.
* CAN FD: Used in post-June 2023 ccNC vehicles. It features a flexible data rate that can switch to higher speeds (up to 5-8 Mbps) during the data transmission phase and supports a payload of up to 64 bytes per frame.
The Diagnostic "Cliff": This transition created a hard break in tool compatibility. Legacy diagnostic interfaces (VCI-I, VCI-II) and standard OBD-II dongles designed for Classic CAN simply cannot interpret CAN FD frames. They lack the hardware transceivers to switch clock speeds mid-frame and the buffer memory to handle the larger 64-byte payloads. Connecting a legacy tool to a 2024 Hyundai Kona will result in a communication failure; the tool will likely detect voltage but will be unable to decipher the high-speed bitstream.
To service these vehicles, technicians must use a CAN FD Adapter or upgrade to a next-generation VCI (e.g., the Hyundai GDS-Mobile VCI-III or aftermarket tools like the Autel MaxiFlash VCI with CAN FD support). This hardware requirement is absolute; there is no software workaround for a tool that lacks the physical CAN FD transceiver.


 Image 4.3 Diagnostic Workflow Protocol
With the fragmentation of the fleet into Legacy, SGW, and CAN FD architectures, the diagnostic workflow has become a decision-tree process. Technicians can no longer simply "plug and play." The following logic defines the modern service protocol:
1. Identify Model Year & Architecture:
   * Is the vehicle a 2024+ model built on the ccNC platform (e.g., Kona, Santa Fe, EV9)?
      * YES: Proceed to Protocol A (CAN FD). A CAN FD-capable VCI is mandatory. Access to the SGW will be digital-only (AutoAuth) as physical bypasses are increasingly integrated and inaccessible on these platforms.
   * Is the vehicle a 2018-2023 model?
      * YES: Proceed to Protocol B (SGW Legacy). A standard VCI is sufficient, but SGW authentication is required. This can be achieved via AutoAuth (software) or a physical 12+8 bypass cable if the module is accessible.
2. Identify Ignition Type (For Pre-2022 Models):
   * Does the vehicle have a Turn-Key Ignition?
      * YES: Check for Campaign 993 status. Be aware that the BCM may be in "Virtual Immobilizer" mode. If the vehicle is a "No Start," prioritize checking the alarm state and door lock cylinder inputs before suspecting mechanical failure.
   * Does the vehicle have Push Button Start?
      * YES: Standard immobilizer diagnostics apply. Campaign 993 logic is not present.
5. Key Fob Forensic & SQL Data Architecture
For database administrators and security engineers, the fragmentation of key fob FCC IDs, transponder chips, and encryption protocols is the most complex aspect of the 2019-2025 era. The data reveals a distinct bifurcation between "Legacy/Transitional" fobs and "Modern CAN FD" fobs, complicating the generation of the vehicles_master SQL table.
5.1 The TQ8 Matrix: Deciphering the IDs
The FCC ID prefix TQ8 is ubiquitous across HMG vehicles, serving as the identifier for the transmitter design. However, the suffix is critical. Physically identical fobs are often logically incompatible due to differences in the manufacturer code (e.g., Mobis vs. Continental) and the underlying transponder architecture.
5.1.1 The "4F24" vs. "4F27" Incompatibility
A major pain point in the aftermarket is the confusion between the TQ8-FOB-4F24 (Kia) and TQ8-FOB-4F27 (Hyundai) series.
* TQ8-FOB-4F24: This fob is used primarily on the 2020-2022 Kia Telluride, Sportage, and Niro. It utilizes the Hitag 3 (PCF7953/ID47) chip architecture.
* TQ8-FOB-4F27: This fob is used primarily on the 2022-2024 Hyundai Palisade and Santa Fe. While it also uses a Hitag 3 architecture and operates on the same 433 MHz frequency, the manufacturer code programmed into the remote's integrated circuit (IC) is different.
* Result: A 4F24 fob cannot be programmed to a 4F27 vehicle. The BCM rejects the manufacturer ID during the "Key Learning" handshake. Database entries must strictly separate these despite their visual similarity.
5.1.2 The Next-Gen: Hitag AES (4A/8A Chips)
The 2023/2024 shift to ccNC/CAN FD introduced a completely new family of keys that are not backward compatible with the Hitag 3 systems.
* Chip Type: Hitag AES (128-bit), often referred to as ID4A or ID8A in locksmith tools. This represents a significant upgrade in encryption strength over the older Hitag 3 standard.
* Key Models:
   * TQ8-FOB-4F61M43: Found on the 2024 Hyundai Kona and 2024 Hyundai Sonata. This is the new standard for Hyundai's CAN FD sedans and compact SUVs.
   * TQ8-FOB-4F81M44: Found on the 2024 Kia Sorento. Note the "81" vs "61" distinction in the suffix, likely differentiating vehicle class or brand-specific encryption keys.
   * SY5KA4FGE07: Used on the 2022-2024 Kia Carnival. This fob features a unique 7-button layout to control the power sliding doors and hatch. The specific button topology is hardcoded into the fob's firmware, making it unique to the minivan platform.
5.2 SQL Generation Logic for vehicles_master
When constructing the vehicles_master database to support accurate key provisioning and diagnostic tool selection, the following boolean flags and logic dependencies must be enforced. This logic ensures that the database accurately reflects the security architecture of each specific trim and model year.

6. Insight & Strategic Implications
6.1 The "Software-as-Hardware" Fragility
The reliance on Campaign 993 reveals a critical insight into automotive legacy support. HMG attempted to solve a hardware deficiency (lack of immobilizer) with a software patch (BCM logic change). The resulting "Dead Fob" failure mode demonstrates the inherent fragility of this approach. By making the start authorization dependent on a volatile signal (RKE Unlock) rather than a passive, energetic signal (RFID Transponder), the system trades security for reliability. This "virtual immobilizer" architecture is a temporary bridge that will eventually disappear as the 2011-2021 fleet ages out, but until then, it remains a critical support issue that requires specialized knowledge to diagnose.
6.2 The "Bypass" Economy
The rapid evolution from SGW (Physical Bypass) to AutoAuth (Digital Bypass) to CAN FD (Hardware Adapter) has created a fragmented tool economy. Locksmiths and repair shops now require a tiered toolkit: standard tools for pre-2018, 12+8 cables for the 2018-2022 SGW era, and CAN FD adapters with active subscriptions for the post-2023 ccNC era. This fragmentation increases the "barrier to entry" for servicing HMG vehicles, potentially driving higher repair costs and pushing consumers back to dealerships for relatively simple services like key programming.
6.3 The Future of the "Universal" Key
The proliferation of specific FCC IDs—such as the split between 4F24 and 4F27, and the nuanced 4F61/81 variations—suggests that HMG is actively diversifying its supplier base for security components and tightening cryptographic pairing. While this increases supply chain resilience, it defeats the aftermarket's attempt to create "Universal" remotes. The distinct manufacturer codes embedded in the ICs of visually identical remotes indicate that vehicles_master databases must move away from "visual identification" of keys toward strict VIN-based Part Number verification. The era of the "universal" key is ending, replaced by a model of strict cryptographic specificity.
7. Conclusion
The 2019-2025 period for Kia and Hyundai was defined by two opposing forces: reaction and modernization. Reaction to the theft crisis forced the deployment of Campaign 993, a clever but imperfect software patch that emulated hardware security at the cost of operational simplicity. Modernization, driven by the vision of the connected car (ccNC), forced the adoption of CAN FD and SGW, raising the technological floor for service and diagnostics. For the security professional and database administrator, the key takeaway is the absolute necessity of distinguishing the Electrical Architecture (Gen5W vs. ccNC) rather than relying solely on Model Year, as the staggered rollout of these technologies has created a complex matrix of compatibility that requires precise, data-driven management.

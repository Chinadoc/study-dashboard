Title: Comprehensive Analysis of 2022 Jeep Compass OEM Smart Key Inventory: VIN Verification Protocols, FCC ID Logic, and Data Integration Strategies
Executive Summary
The modern automotive parts ecosystem has evolved from static, linear catalogs into complex, dynamic configuration databases. This transition is most evident in the security and access control categories, where the proliferation of "Smart Keys," "Proximity Fobs," and "Keyless Go" systems has introduced a layer of opacity for inventory managers and locksmith professionals. The query at hand—regarding the 2022 Jeep Compass and its confusing catalog entries featuring multiple FCC IDs and the imperative to "Verify by VIN"—highlights a critical friction point in the industry: the disconnect between physical inventory and digital vehicle configuration.
This report serves as a definitive technical dossier designed for inventory data specialists, parts managers, and automotive security professionals. It addresses the user’s specific challenges: distinguishing between the valid M3N-40821302 and the erroneous GQ4-54T FCC IDs, deconstructing the "Verify by VIN" mechanism in the absence of a traditional linear chart, and providing a robust data schema for integrating these variables into a proprietary inventory system.
Our analysis confirms that the 2022 Jeep Compass, built on the FCA Small Wide 4x4 (MP) architecture, exclusively utilizes the M3N-40821302 FCC ID with an AES 4A transponder and SIP22 keyway. The presence of the GQ4-54T ID in catalogs is a documented data contamination error, likely stemming from cross-listing with the Jeep Cherokee (KL) platform. Furthermore, this report establishes that no static "VIN Series to Part Number" chart exists due to the modular nature of Stellantis "Sales Code" manufacturing. Instead, inventory accuracy requires a logic-based approach where the VIN is decoded to reveal specific equipment codes—specifically JRC for Power Liftgate and XBM for Remote Start. This document provides the necessary algorithms, data structures, and technical context to construct that logic within an external inventory management environment.
1. The Architectural Context: Why the Catalog is Confusing
To resolve the inventory discrepancy, one must first understand the engineering context of the vehicle. The confusion between the two listed FCC IDs is not merely a clerical error; it is a symptom of platform convergence and divergence within the Stellantis (formerly FCA) portfolio. Understanding the underlying platform architecture explains why the catalog displays conflicting data and provides the first filter for data sanitization.
1.1 The MP Platform vs. The KL Platform
The 2022 Jeep Compass rides on the MP platform, a derivative of the Small Wide 4x4 architecture.1 This architecture is shared globally with the Jeep Renegade (BU) and the Fiat 500X. This shared DNA dictates the physical and electronic characteristics of the key fob. Specifically, the "Fiat" influence is visible in the use of the SIP22 keyway (a milled, rectangular blade) and the specific 434 MHz frequency modulation used by the Continental-sourced Radio Frequency Hub (RFHub).
In contrast, the Jeep Cherokee rides on the Compact Wide (KL) platform. While the two vehicles appear similar in size and branding, their electronic architectures are distinct. The Cherokee utilizes a system often supplied by TRW or other vendors, utilizing the GQ4-54T FCC ID and the Y159 keyway.3
The root cause of the catalog confusion identified in the user query is the visual similarity between these two "Smart Keys." Both use a "Tombstone" shape (rounded top, flat bottom) with similar button layouts. However, they are electronically and physically incompatible. Automated catalog scraping tools often conflate "Jeep SUV 2022" entries, merging the KL and MP datasets. This results in the erroneous listing of GQ4-54T for the Compass.
1.2 The Evolution of the RFHub and Transponders
The 2022 Compass is equipped with a high-security Radio Frequency Hub (RFHub) that manages both the Passive Entry (Keyless Go) and Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) functions. This module represents a significant leap forward from previous generations, utilizing the NXP Hitag AES transponder technology.5
* Legacy Systems (Hitag 2 / ID46): Older Jeep models used the PCF7941 chip. These are often referred to as "Proximity" keys in older catalogs but are technologically obsolete for the 2022 model.
* Modern Systems (AES 4A): The 2022 Compass RFHub requires a 128-bit AES encrypted signal. In the locksmith industry, this is often shorthand referred to as the "4A" chip system.7
The implication for inventory management is severe: a key fob may look identical and even transmit on the correct frequency (433/434 MHz), but if it contains a legacy ID46 chip instead of the AES 4A chip, the vehicle's RFHub will reject it immediately during the programming sequence. Therefore, "Verify by VIN" is not just about button configurations; it is about ensuring the transponder generation matches the vehicle's production date and platform standard.
1.3 The Security Gateway (SGW) Firewall
Another critical factor in the 2022 ecosystem is the Security Gateway Module (SGW). Introduced across the FCA lineup starting in 2018, the SGW acts as a firewall between the vehicle's diagnostic port (OBDII) and the internal CAN bus networks.8
While the SGW does not change the part number of the key, it fundamentally changes the serviceability of the inventory. A customer purchasing a 2022 Compass key cannot simply take it to a generic hardware store for cloning or programming. The programming process requires a locksmith or dealer with access to "AutoAuth" or the official wiTECH 2.0 diagnostic suite to bypass the SGW. Inventory notes must reflect this requirement to prevent returns from customers who mistakenly believe the key is defective when, in reality, their programmer lacked the credentials to breach the SGW firewall.
2. Deconstructing the "Verify by VIN" Protocol
The user's query explicitly asks, "How do you verify by VIN?" and "Do you have a chart?" These questions strike at the core of a major misconception in automotive parts cataloging: the idea that parts are mapped to sequential VIN ranges. In modern "Just-in-Time" manufacturing, parts are mapped to Sales Codes (Option Codes), and the VIN is merely the key to unlock the list of codes for a specific unit.
2.1 The Fallacy of the VIN Series Chart
Historically, manufacturers might have stated, "All vehicles from VIN 000001 to 100000 use Part A." This was possible when options were bundled rigidly. However, for a vehicle like the 2022 Jeep Compass, the configuration is modular. A vehicle rolling off the assembly line at 10:00 AM might be a Sport trim with no options (3-button key). The vehicle immediately behind it, with the next sequential VIN, might be a Limited trim with the "Elite Group" package (5-button key).
Therefore, no linear chart exists that maps VIN ranges (e.g., "Starts with 1C4...") directly to key part numbers. The "Series" is not numerical; it is logical. The VIN allows access to the Vehicle Build Sheet, a database record that lists every single "Sales Code" associated with that chassis.
2.2 The Verification Mechanism
To "Verify by VIN" effectively, one must replicate the logic used by the OEM parts counter. This process involves three distinct steps:
1. Decoding: The 17-digit VIN is submitted to a data provider (e.g., Stellantis TechAuthority, a Dealer Management System, or a third-party API like KeyCode).
2. Extraction: The system retrieves the "Option List" or "Build Sheet." This is a list of 3-character alphanumeric codes (e.g., XBM, JRC, GXD).
3. Filtration: The inventory logic compares the extracted codes against the prerequisites for each available key part number.


  



2.3 The Role of VIN Decoders vs. Build Sheets
It is crucial to distinguish between a "VIN Decoder" and a "Build Sheet Lookup."
* VIN Decoder: Analyzes the 17 digits to determine the Country of Origin (1st digit), Manufacturer (2nd), Platform (4th-8th), and Model Year (10th).10 A basic decoder can tell you the vehicle is a "2022 Jeep Compass MP" made in Mexico. It cannot tell you if the vehicle has Remote Start.
* Build Sheet Lookup: Uses the VIN as a query key against the OEM database to return the specific equipment list. For smart key verification, a basic decoder is insufficient because the button configuration depends on optional equipment (Remote Start, Liftgate) that is not encoded in the 17-digit string.
This distinction explains why "Verify by VIN" is often a manual or API-driven process rather than a simple lookup table. The inventory manager must have access to a data source that provides the Sales Codes, not just the Model Year.
3. Resolving the FCC ID Conflict: M3N-40821302 vs. GQ4-54T
The user's catalog currently lists two FCC IDs, creating significant uncertainty. Based on a comprehensive review of the research materials and platform architecture, we can definitively separate the signal from the noise.
3.1 The Correct Spec: FCC ID M3N-40821302
The M3N-40821302 is the correct, validated FCC ID for the 2022 Jeep Compass (MP).5
* Frequency: 433.92 MHz (often listed as 434 MHz).
* OEM Manufacturer: Continental.
* Chipset: NXP Hitag AES (4A).
* Keyway: SIP22 (Milled/Laser Cut).
* Part Number Series: 6825xxxx and 6841xxxx.
This ID corresponds to the RFHub used in the MP platform (Compass) and the BU platform (Renegade). The electronics are designed to communicate with the specific rolling code algorithm implemented in these vehicles.
3.2 The Contaminant: FCC ID GQ4-54T
The GQ4-54T is a valid Jeep smart key ID, but it belongs to the Jeep Cherokee (KL) and certain RAM trucks.3
* Frequency: 433.92 MHz.
* OEM Manufacturer: TRW.
* Chipset: Often Hitag AES, but structurally different.
* Keyway: Y159 / Y160 (Edge Cut or different milling).
* Status: INCOMPATIBLE with the 2022 Compass.
The inclusion of GQ4-54T in a Compass catalog is a critical error. While the fobs look visually similar (both are black, rounded "tombstone" shapes), they are physically and electronically distinct. Attempting to program a GQ4-54T key to a Compass will fail, resulting in inventory shrinkage and customer returns.
3.3 The "Blade Test" for Physical Verification
For inventory managers with physical access to the stock, the most reliable way to distinguish between these two conflicting IDs—aside from reading the label—is to inspect the Emergency Key Blade. The blade interface is the physical "handshake" that prevents cross-platform usage.
* Compass (M3N-40821302): Uses the SIP22 blade. This is a "track cut" key, meaning the bitting is milled into the flat face of the blade. The blade is relatively thin and has a distinct rectangular cross-section.16
* Cherokee (GQ4-54T): Uses the Y159 blade. This blade is wider and often features a different head geometry where it locks into the fob.18


  



By verifying the blade type, an inventory manager can instantly identify and quarantine any GQ4-54T keys that have been incorrectly binned with the Compass stock.
4. The Sales Code Logic Matrix: The "Chart" You Need
Since a linear VIN chart does not exist, the solution is to build a Logic Matrix based on the Sales Codes discussed in Section 2. This matrix serves as the translation layer between the vehicle's features and the part number. This section provides the specific data points required to populate that matrix in an inventory system.
4.1 Defining the Critical Sales Codes
To select the correct key, the inventory system must query for the presence of specific codes. The three primary drivers for the 2022 Compass are:
1. GX4 (Keyless Go / Push Button Start): This code confirms the vehicle is equipped with the proximity smart key system. If a vehicle lacks this code (extremely rare for the 2022 North American model), it would likely use a bladed key. Note: Do not confuse with GXD (Remote Keyless Entry), which is the base system.20
2. XBM (Remote Start System): This is the differentiator for the Remote Start Button. A key with this button will transmit a specific signal that the BCM only recognizes if XBM is enabled in the vehicle configuration.22
3. JRC (Power Liftgate): This code dictates the presence of the Tailgate Release Button. For the Compass, this is often a "double tap" button. Using a key with this button on a manual liftgate vehicle is harmless, but the button will be non-functional. Conversely, providing a key without this button to a JRC-equipped vehicle results in a loss of functionality for the customer.2
4.2 The Part Number Hierarchy
Based on the synthesis of multiple data sources 13, we can construct the specific hierarchy of part numbers. It is important to note that Mopar frequently updates part numbers (supersession). The matrix below accounts for both the "Primary" (current) and "Alternate" (previous/interchangeable) numbers.
Variant A: 5-Button Smart Key (Full Feature)
* Target Vehicle: High-trim models (Limited, Trailhawk, High Altitude) equipped with both Remote Start and Power Liftgate.
* Logic: IF (SalesCode HAS 'XBM') AND (SalesCode HAS 'JRC')
* Button Layout: Lock, Unlock, Panic, Remote Start, Power Liftgate.
* Part Numbers: 68250343AB (Current), 68250343AA, 68417823AB, 68417823AA.
Variant B: 4-Button Smart Key (Remote Start Only)
* Target Vehicle: Mid-trim models (Latitude, Altitude) equipped with Remote Start but a manual liftgate.
* Logic: IF (SalesCode HAS 'XBM') AND (SalesCode DOES NOT HAVE 'JRC')
* Button Layout: Lock, Unlock, Panic, Remote Start.
* Part Numbers: 68250337AB (Current), 68250337AA, 68417821AB, 68417821AA.
Variant C: 3-Button Smart Key (Base)
* Target Vehicle: Base models (Sport) with no remote start and manual liftgate.
* Logic: IF (SalesCode DOES NOT HAVE 'XBM') AND (SalesCode DOES NOT HAVE 'JRC')
* Button Layout: Lock, Unlock, Panic.
* Part Numbers: 68250335AB (Current), 68250335AA, 68417820AB, 68417820AA.


  



4.3 Handling Part Number Supersessions
A common point of confusion is the existence of two distinct part number "families" for the same key: the 6825- series and the 6841- series.
* The 6825 Series: Typically the original production part numbers associated with the launch of the MP platform.
* The 6841 Series: Often represents a supplier change or a newer batch production run to address component shortages.
* Interchangeability: Research indicates that for the 2022 Compass, these series are functional equivalents provided the button count matches.13 Your inventory system should link these numbers. For example, a search for 68250343AB should also return stock levels for 68417823AB.
5. Integrating Data into Your Inventory System
The user's final requirement is to "add this data to my own inventory system." Simply treating these keys as generic "Jeep Keys" is insufficient. To support the logic described above, the inventory database must be structured to handle relational data rather than flat text fields.
5.1 Recommended Data Schema
A robust inventory system for automotive security parts requires separating the Physical Attributes (what the key is) from the Logical Attributes (what the key does).
We recommend implementing a relational schema with three core tables:
1. Product_Master: Stores the static data about the key (FCC ID, Frequency, Blade Type).
2. Vehicle_Application: Links the key to the specific Model Year and Platform (Compass 2022 / MP).
3. Compatibility_Rules: Stores the Sales Code logic required to verify the key against a specific VIN.
5.2 Implementation Logic
By structuring the data this way, you can implement an automated verification script:
* Input: VIN
* Process:
   1. Call API to get Build Sheet -> Extract Codes.
   2. Query Compatibility_Rules -> Find Key where Rule_RemoteStart = TRUE and Rule_Liftgate = TRUE.
   3. Return Part Number 68250343AB.


  



5.3 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
To automate the "Verify by VIN" process, your inventory system will need to connect to an external data provider. Manual entry of sales codes is prone to error.
* Stellantis TechAuthority: The official source, though access is typically restricted to authorized dealers and locksmiths.
* Third-Party Decoders: Services like DataOne, ChromeData, or specialized locksmith APIs (e.g., AutoCode) can return the "Installed Equipment" list. Ensure your provider returns Option Codes (Sales Codes), not just generic descriptions.
6. Global Considerations: Frequency and Region
While the user's catalog likely focuses on the North American market (NAFTA), it is vital to acknowledge global variations, especially given the global nature of the Jeep Compass (MP) platform, which is manufactured in Mexico, Brazil, China, India, and Italy.
6.1 The 433 vs. 315 MHz Divide
* North America (NAFTA): The 2022 Compass utilizes 433.92 MHz. This is a shift from older Chrysler/Jeep norms which often used 315 MHz.
* Europe (EMEA): Also utilizes 433.92 MHz, but often with different Region Codes embedded in the BCM configuration. A US-spec M3N key may not program to a European Compass due to mismatched "Market" bytes in the transponder data, even if the frequency matches.
* Asia (APAC): Frequencies vary by specific country regulations (e.g., Japan often uses 315 MHz, South Korea 433 MHz).
6.2 Identifying "Grey Market" Vehicles
Inventory managers must be vigilant for imported vehicles. The VIN is the primary indicator:
* Starts with 1, 4, 5: US Built (Not applicable to Compass MP).
* Starts with 3: Mexico (Primary source for North American Compass).
* Starts with Z: Italy (European market).
* Starts with M: India or Thailand (Asian market).
If a customer presents a VIN starting with Z or M, do not sell them the standard US-market M3N-40821302 key without strictly verifying the specific part number required for that region, as the US key will likely be incompatible.
7. Programming and Service Considerations
The responsibility of the inventory manager extends to setting customer expectations regarding the usability of the sold part. The 2022 Compass introduces specific hurdles for programming that must be communicated at the point of sale.
7.1 The "Virgin" vs. "Unlocked" Status
Smart keys are generally "Write Once" devices. Once programmed to a vehicle, the transponder locks to that specific VIN.
* New OEM: These are "Virgin" keys and can be programmed immediately.
* Refurbished/Used: A used key from another vehicle cannot be reprogrammed unless it has been "unlocked" or "re-flashed" to a virgin state.13 Selling a standard used key without this service will result in a failed programming attempt. Inventory data should explicitly flag items as "New" or "Refurbished - Unlocked."
7.2 PIN Codes and the SGW
As noted in Section 1.3, the Security Gateway (SGW) prevents unauthorized tools from accessing the BCM.
* Service Requirement: The customer cannot program this key themselves. There is no "On Board Programming" (OBP) procedure.13
* Professional Required: They must hire an automotive locksmith or dealer equipped with an internet-connected tool (e.g., Autel IM608, Smart Pro) that is registered with AutoAuth. This service usually incurs an additional cost beyond the price of the key. Including a "Professional Programming Required" note in your inventory output or invoice is a best practice to reduce disputes.
8. Summary Master Reference
To summarize the findings for quick reference, the following table consolidates the button configurations, part numbers, and critical verification criteria.


  



9. Conclusion
The confusion surrounding the 2022 Jeep Compass smart key inventory is a manageable data challenge once the underlying platform architecture is understood. The presence of the GQ4-54T FCC ID in catalogs is a demonstrable error; the 2022 Compass MP exclusively uses the M3N-40821302 ID with the SIP22 blade and AES 4A transponder.
To "Verify by VIN" effectively, inventory managers must move beyond the search for a non-existent linear chart and adopt a logic-based verification workflow. By leveraging the Sales Code Matrix—specifically checking for XBM (Remote Start) and JRC (Liftgate)—and implementing the relational data schema proposed in this report, you can transform your inventory system from a static list into a dynamic, error-proof verification tool. This approach not only resolves the immediate "two FCC ID" conflict but also future-proofs your operations against the increasing complexity of automotive access control systems.

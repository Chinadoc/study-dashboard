1. Executive Summary
The automotive security landscape has undergone a radical transformation between 2020 and 2025, driven largely by Toyota's migration from the legacy "H-Chip" (128-bit Texas Instruments DST-AES) architecture to two distinct, highly encrypted next-generation platforms: the 8A-BA (TMLF19D) and the 4A (TMLF19T) systems. This bifurcation represents a strategic move by Toyota to harden their "Smart Key" ecosystem against replay attacks and cloning, creating a complex environment for security professionals, locksmiths, and hardware engineers.
This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the Toyota HYQ14FBx FCC ID family, a critical hardware series that bridges the gap between these generations. Through forensic analysis of FCC filings, aftermarket programming data, and circuit board schematics, this document establishes the definitive "Source of Truth" for the 2020-2025 Toyota transponder lineup.
The investigation reveals a pivotal divergence in Toyota's engineering philosophy. No longer does a single transponder standard govern the lineup. Instead, the "HYQ14..." FCC ID prefix—previously a reliable indicator of compatibility—now masks a fundamental architectural split. On one side lies the Texas Instruments DST-AES (8A-BA) infrastructure, predominantly deployed in the brand's body-on-frame trucks and luxury SUVs. On the other stands the NXP HITAG AES (4A) architecture, which has permeated the unibody passenger car segment, including the high-volume Corolla and the redesigned 2025 Camry.
This report addresses the specific data points requested: the precise chip mapping for the HYQ14FBW, HYQ14FBN, and HYQ14FBB; the distinction between ID49, ID8A-BA, and HITAG AES; the confirmation of the TOY51 keyway standard; and the exhaustive vehicle compatibility lists for each node in this new security network.

2. Technical Architecture Analysis: The Great Schism
To understand the specific FCC IDs requested (HYQ14FBx), one must first deconstruct the underlying architectures. The years 2020-2025 represent a "schism" in Toyota's security engineering, moving away from a unified transponder standard. This period is characterized by the obsolescence of the legacy "H-Chip" and the rise of two parallel, incompatible systems. Understanding this dichotomy is essential for interpreting part numbers and programming protocols.
2.1. The Legacy 8A System (DST-AES)
The "Legacy 8A" system represents the baseline for Toyota's smart key technology from approximately 2013 through 2021, extending to 2023 on certain platforms like the 3rd Generation Tacoma.1
* Core Logic: This system utilizes Texas Instruments 128-bit AES encryption. It is often referred to in the industry as the "H-Chip" smart system, a nomenclature derived from the 'H' stamped on the metal key blades of the mechanical equivalents, though the smart keys utilize a different modulation.
* Identification: Transponders in this family typically read with a Page 1 configuration of "88", "A8", or "A9" when interrogated by a locksmith tool.3
* Vulnerability & Obsolescence: While secure by the standards of the mid-2010s, this system relied on a static exchange that eventually allowed for "simulation" via third-party emulators. Security researchers and aftermarket tool manufacturers (such as Lonsdor and Xhorse) developed methods to simulate the presence of a master key via the OBDII port without needing to breach the Smart Box physically.4 This vulnerability likely accelerated Toyota's push toward the newer, more robust architectures discussed below.
* Vehicle Examples: The 2016-2023 Toyota Tacoma and the 2020-2021 Toyota 4Runner are the primary carriers of this legacy architecture in the late-model lineup.2
2.2. The 8A-BA System (TMLF19D)
Introduced around 2020, the 8A-BA system is the direct evolution of the Legacy 8A, specifically hardened for Toyota's high-value "TNGA-F" (Toyota New Global Architecture - Frame) platforms. This includes trucks, large SUVs, and the luxury Lexus LX/NX segments.
* Target Platforms: Trucks (Tundra, Tacoma 2024), Large SUVs (Sequoia, Land Cruiser), and the RAV4 Prime/Hybrid variants.5
* Smart Box: The system is governed by the TMLF19D Smart ECU, manufactured primarily by Denso.7
* Core Logic: It retains the Texas Instruments DST-AES foundation but introduces a modified memory structure. The "BA" designation refers to the hexadecimal data located in Page 1 of the transponder's configuration memory, which now reads as BA instead of the legacy 88 or A9.8
* Security Mechanism: The 8A-BA system introduces a robust Rolling Code scheme that prevents simple emulation. Unlike the Legacy 8A, which could often be bypassed via OBDII, the 8A-BA system requires an ADP (Authorization Data Proxy) adapter or a direct connection to the CAN bus to read the IMMO data backup.9 The TMLF19D box is notoriously difficult to communicate with via OBDII without these specialized bypass cables (e.g., the Toyota-30 pin cable) that physically interrupt the connection to the smart box to inject security credentials.10
2.3. The 4A System (TMLF19T)
Emerging in parallel with the 8A-BA, the 4A system represents a complete departure from Texas Instruments. This architecture is built on NXP Semiconductors' HITAG AES platform. It appears Toyota selected this architecture for its global unibody platforms ("TNGA-C" and "TNGA-K"), likely due to supply chain diversification or integration with specific body control modules favored in these segments.
* Target Platforms: Compacts, Sedans, Crossovers (Corolla, Corolla Cross, Yaris, Prius, and notably the 2025 Camry).11
* Smart Box: The system is governed by the TMLF19T Smart ECU, manufactured primarily by Tokai Rika.7
* Core Logic: NXP HITAG AES (128-bit). This is a fundamental hardware change. A key programmed for an 8A system cannot physically communicate with a 4A system, even if the frequency is identical.13
* Identification: Chips read as ID4A, HITAG 128-bit AES, or specifically as the NXP NCF29A1M integrated circuit.12
* Security Mechanism: This architecture shares similarities with Nissan/Renault's AES systems (which also use NXP silicon). It utilizes a specific password-free matching algorithm that differs entirely from the 8A-BA handshake. Programming requires tools capable of handling the HITAG AES challenge-response protocol, often necessitating specific updates to programmers like the Autel IM608 or Lonsdor K518.9
Strategic Insight: The decision to split into 8A-BA and 4A appears to be a definitive strategy to separate the heavy-duty/luxury lines from the mass-market passenger lines. The "TNGA-F" (truck) platforms stayed with the Denso/TI (8A-BA) lineage, while the "TNGA-C" and "TNGA-K" (compact/sedan) platforms moved toward the Tokai Rika/NXP (4A) ecosystem. This explains the confusion in the market: why does a 2025 Camry use a different chip technology than a 2024 Tacoma? The answer lies in their platform DNA—unibody vs. body-on-frame.

3. Comprehensive Chip & FCC ID Specification
This section provides the exhaustive mapping requested, resolving the ambiguity between the "FBW", "FBN", "FBB", "FBX", and "FLA" identifiers. Each FCC ID represents a specific hardware configuration within the architectural framework defined above.
3.1. HYQ14FBW: The New Standard for Sedans (4A Architecture)
The HYQ14FBW is currently the flagship smart key for Toyota's modern sedan and crossover lineup. It is crucial to note that despite some aftermarket listings that may mislabel it as "8A" due to legacy naming conventions or the "H" logo on the shell, forensic board analysis confirms this is a HITAG AES (4A) system.8
* Chip Type: NXP HITAG AES (ID4A).
   * Specific IC: NCF29A1M.12
   * Transponder ID: Reads as "4A" on diagnostic tools.
   * Architecture: 4A (TMLF19T).
* Frequency: 315 MHz (Note: Some documentation mentions dual-band 314.3 MHz capability, but 315 MHz is the primary operational carrier for the US market).
* Board ID: 2561.
   * PCB Marking: 231451-2561 "G".8 This Board ID is the definitive identifier; if a key has this number, it is a 4A system key.
* FCC ID: HYQ14FBW.
* IC: 1551A-14FBW.
* Keyway: TOY51 (High Security, also referred to as LXP90 in Ilco catalogs).8
* Confirmed Vehicle Mapping:
   * Toyota Camry: 2025 (New Generation).11 The transition of the Camry to HYQ14FBW in 2025 marks the end of the 8A era for Toyota's best-selling sedan, aligning it with the Corolla's 4A architecture.
   * Toyota Corolla: 2023–2025 (Sedan & Hatchback).16
   * Toyota GR Corolla: 2023–2025.18
   * Toyota Corolla Cross: 2022–2025.8
   * Toyota Prius / Prius Prime: 2023–2024.12
* OEM Part Numbers:
   * 8990H-AQ010 (Camry 2025).
   * 8990H-12350 (Corolla).
   * 8990H-0A010 / 8990H-12560 (Corolla Cross).
   * 8990H-12460 (GR Corolla).
Market Implication: The unification of the Camry, Corolla, and Prius under the HYQ14FBW (4A) standard simplifies inventory for locksmiths but necessitates the acquisition of 4A-compatible programming hardware (e.g., Autel G-Box3 or Lonsdor ADP) for these high-volume models.
3.2. HYQ14FBN: The 4A Precursor
The HYQ14FBN acts as the immediate predecessor and stablemate to the FBW. It utilizes the same 4A (HITAG AES) architecture but was largely restricted to the Corolla platform during the 2019-2022 window before the widespread adoption of the FBW variant.
* Chip Type: NXP HITAG AES (ID4A).
   * Note: Often mislabeled as "Chip H" in generic catalogs due to visual similarities, but strictly requires 4A programming software.20
* Frequency: 315 MHz.
* Board ID: 2000.
   * PCB Marking: 231451-2000.21
* FCC ID: HYQ14FBN.
* Keyway: TOY51.
* Confirmed Vehicle Mapping:
   * Toyota Corolla: 2019–2022.20
   * Toyota Corolla Hatchback: 2019–2022.23
* OEM Part Numbers:
   * 8990H-12180.20
   * 8990H-02030.22
3.3. HYQ14FBB: The Legacy 8A Workhorse
The HYQ14FBB represents the "Standard 8A" (DST-AES) generation. Crucially, it is not a "BA" system. It does not require the new ADP adapters or 30-pin cables for programming, making it significantly easier to service than the FBX/FLA/FBW series. It is the last of the "easy" Toyota smart keys.
* Chip Type: Texas Instruments DST-AES (ID8A).
   * Page 1 Config: 88, A8, or A9 (Distinctly NOT BA).
* Frequency: 315 MHz.
* Board ID: 0010.
   * PCB Marking: 231451-0010 "G".1
* FCC ID: HYQ14FBB.
* Keyway: TOY51.25
* Confirmed Vehicle Mapping:
   * Toyota 4Runner: 2020–2021 (See transition note below).1
   * Toyota Tacoma: 2016–2023 (3rd Generation).2
   * Toyota Tundra: 2018–2021 (Previous Generation).24
   * Toyota Land Cruiser: 2020–2021.
   * Lexus: RX350 (2016–2022), LX570 (2016–2021).26
* OEM Part Numbers:
   * 89904-35060 (Tacoma/4Runner).
   * 89904-0C050 (Tundra).
Transition Note: The 4Runner presents a unique case of mid-cycle architecture switching. While 2020-2021 models use HYQ14FBB (Legacy 8A), the 2022-2024 models transitioned to HYQ14FLA (8A-BA). This electronic update occurred without a major exterior facelift, creating a common trap for technicians who assume all "5th Gen" 4Runners use the same key.27
3.4. HYQ14FBX: The 8A-BA Heavyweight
The HYQ14FBX is the primary key fob for Toyota's new "TNGA-F" truck platform and flagship SUVs. It is the definitive 8A-BA system, representing the highest level of security currently deployed by Toyota in North America.
* Chip Type: Texas Instruments DST-AES (ID8A).
   * Page 1 Config: BA.28
   * Architecture: 8A-BA (TMLF19D).
* Frequency: 315 MHz.
* Board ID: 3041.
   * PCB Marking: 231451-3041 "G".29
* FCC ID: HYQ14FBX.
* Keyway: TOY51 (High Security).
* Confirmed Vehicle Mapping:
   * Toyota Tacoma: 2024 (Next Gen).6
   * Toyota Tundra: 2022–2025.29
   * Toyota Sequoia: 2023–2025.32
   * Toyota Sienna: 2021–2025 (Hybrid).33 Note: The Sienna uses the TNGA-K platform but shares the TMLF19D (8A-BA) architecture with the trucks, likely due to shared electronic components in the hybrid powertrain management.
   * Toyota Venza: 2021–2024.34
   * Toyota Land Cruiser: 2024 (250 Series).6
   * Toyota Grand Highlander: 2024.35
   * Toyota Crown: 2023–2025.36
* OEM Part Numbers:
   * 8990H-0C030 (Tacoma 2024).
   * 8990H-0C020 (Sequoia).
   * 8990H-08020 (Sienna).
The "Locked" Nature: Unlike the FBB (Legacy 8A), the FBX (8A-BA) fobs are heavily encrypted. Once programmed to a vehicle, the "rolling code" synchronization between the key and the TMLF19D box makes them extremely difficult to unlock and reuse without specialized "renew" software that can rewrite the specific 8A-BA pages.33
3.5. HYQ14FLA: The 8A-BA Crossover Variant
The HYQ14FLA is the crossover counterpart to the FBX, used primarily in the RAV4 and late-model 4Runner. It is also an 8A-BA system, functionally identical in architecture to the FBX but with different button configurations and shell designs.
* Chip Type: Texas Instruments DST-AES (ID8A).
   * Page 1 Config: BA.
* Frequency: 315 MHz.
* Board ID: 3450.
   * PCB Marking: 231451-3450.27
* FCC ID: HYQ14FLA.
* Keyway: TOY51.
* Confirmed Vehicle Mapping:
   * Toyota RAV4: 2022–2025 (Facelift/Update).38
   * Toyota 4Runner: 2022–2024 (Updated Smart Box).27
   * Toyota Highlander: 2021–2023.37
* OEM Part Numbers:
   * 8990H-35010 (4Runner 2022+).
   * 8990H-0R200 (RAV4).

4. Hardware Deep Dive: Board IDs & Keyways
In the 2020-2025 era, reliance on FCC ID alone has become risky due to shell swapping and shared FCC IDs across different board revisions. The Board ID, printed directly on the green PCB, is the only immutable identifier that guarantees compatibility.


  



4.1. The "G" Board Classification Matrix
The following table synthesizes the correlation between Board IDs, Architectures, and FCC IDs. This is the "Rosetta Stone" for matching 2020+ Toyota keys.
Board ID
	Architecture
	Chip Type
	FCC ID
	Primary Vehicles
	231451-2561
	4A
	NXP HITAG AES
	HYQ14FBW
	Camry '25, Corolla '23+, Prius '23+
	231451-2000
	4A
	NXP HITAG AES
	HYQ14FBN
	Corolla '19-'22
	231451-3041
	8A-BA

	HYQ14FBX
	Tundra '22+, Tacoma '24, Sienna '21+
	231451-3450
	8A-BA
	TI DST-AES
	HYQ14FLA
	RAV4 '22+, 4Runner '22+, Highlander '21+
	231451-0010
	Legacy 8A
	TI DST-AES
	HYQ14FBB
	Tacoma '16-'23, 4Runner '20-'21
	231451-0351
	Legacy 8A
	TI DST-AES
	HYQ14FBC
	Camry '18-'22, RAV4 '19-'21
	4.2. Keyway Confirmation: The Victory of TOY51
The research conclusively identifies TOY51 (LXP90) as the standard emergency keyway for the entire HYQ14FBx/FLx family (2020-2025). This marks the obsolescence of the older standards.
* TOY48: Relegated to older Lexus and legacy Toyota smart keys (pre-2016). It is shorter and has a different milling profile.
* TOY43: Used primarily on non-smart "bladed" keys (e.g., older Tacoma H-key ignitions).
* TOY51 (LXP90): This is the high-security, laser-cut internal track key used on virtually all push-to-start Toyotas from 2018 onwards. It is characterized by a central groove and a thinner profile than the TOY48. It is the only keyway listed for the HYQ14FBW, FBX, and FLA series.2
* Part Numbers: The OEM emergency key blank for these fobs is often referenced as 69515-K0020 (for global platforms like Camry/Corolla) or 69515-33100.42

5. Security Implications & Programming Ecosystem
The shift to 8A-BA and 4A has disrupted the traditional automotive locksmith industry, rendering older programming tools (like the Techstream Lite without security credentials) obsolete for "All Keys Lost" (AKL) scenarios. The days of simple OBDII key addition are largely over for these newer models without specific hardware interventions.
5.1. The "All Keys Lost" Challenge
In Legacy 8A systems (HYQ14FBB), emulators could simulate a master key by exploiting the encryption handshake via the OBDII port. The new systems have closed this loop.
* 8A-BA (HYQ14FBX/FLA) Protocol: The TMLF19D box requires a specific "Rolling Code" authorization that changes with every engine start. To program a key when none exist, technicians must now use an ADP (Authorization Data Proxy) Adapter (e.g., Lonsdor ADP, OBDSTAR Toyota-30 Cable).9
   * Procedure: The technician must locate the Smart Box (usually buried behind the glovebox or passenger kick panel). The Toyota-30 Pin Cable is then connected directly to the Smart Box, interrupting the vehicle's harness. This allows the programming tool to read the EEPROM data directly from the Smart Box, bypassing the gateway module that blocks OBDII access.43
   * Tools: The Lonsdor K518 with ADP adapter and the OBDSTAR X300 DP Plus with the Key SIM and Toyota-30 cable are the industry standards for this operation.7
* 4A (HYQ14FBW) Protocol: The TMLF19T box also requires a bypass for AKL, but the protocol is different. The encryption is NXP-based.
   * Procedure: Tools like the Autel IM508/IM608 have released "Password-Free" matching updates. While often still requiring a G-Box (a specialized breakout box) or a direct connection to the CAN lines (CAN High/CAN Low) to read the backup data, the process is distinct from the 8A-BA method.44
   * Advantage: Some newer updates allow for 4A programming via OBDII if the tool can calculate the PIN code online, making the 4A system slightly more service-friendly than the 8A-BA in certain scenarios.9


  



5.2. Vehicle Compatibility Sharing: The "Cluster" Strategy
One of the most valuable insights for inventory management is understanding which vehicles share the exact same key. Based on the Board IDs and Architectures, we can define three distinct clusters.
* Cluster 1 (The "TNGA-F" 8A-BA Cluster - HYQ14FBX / Board 3041):
   * Shared By: 2024 Tacoma, 2022+ Tundra, 2023+ Sequoia, 2024 Land Cruiser.
   * Technical Nuance: While the chip architecture is identical (Board 3041), the button configuration (e.g., sliding door buttons for Sienna vs. tailgate for Tundra) creates different part numbers. However, for emergency starting, a board from one can often be programmed to another if the button mask is compatible.
* Cluster 2 (The "Compact" 4A Cluster - HYQ14FBW / Board 2561):
   * Shared By: 2025 Camry, 2023+ Corolla, 2022+ Corolla Cross, 2023+ Prius.
   * Inventory Strategy: This is the most versatile key to stock for modern Toyota sedans. The 2025 Camry's adoption of this key cements it as the standard for the next 3-5 years.
* Cluster 3 (The "Transition" 8A-BA Cluster - HYQ14FLA / Board 3450):
   * Shared By: 2022+ RAV4, 2022+ 4Runner, 2021+ Highlander.
   * Inventory Strategy: This key covers the highest-volume SUV segment. It is critical to differentiate this from the visually identical HYQ14FBC (Legacy 8A) used on older RAV4s.
________________
6. Conclusion and Strategic Outlook
The Toyota HYQ14FBx family is not a monolith; it is a collection of three distinct cryptographic standards (Legacy 8A, 8A-BA, and 4A). The primary driver of this fragmentation is the divergence of Toyota's platform engineering, splitting heavy-duty/luxury (Denso/TI) from mass-market passenger (Tokai Rika/NXP).
For the specific query regarding the Toyota 8A-BA Chip Architecture (2020-2025), the definitive answers are:
1. HYQ14FBX and HYQ14FLA are the definitive 8A-BA (TI DST-AES with BA Page 1) fobs.
2. HYQ14FBW and HYQ14FBN are not 8A-BA; they are 4A (NXP HITAG AES).
3. HYQ14FBB is Legacy 8A (TI DST-AES with 88 Page 1).
4. Keyway: TOY51 (LXP90) is the universal standard for all these 2020+ smart keys.
Recommendation for Inventory:
Technicians should prioritize stocking Board 3041 (FBX) and Board 2561 (FBW) as these cover the vast majority of Toyota's forward-looking portfolio (Tacoma, Tundra, Camry, Corolla). The Board 3450 (FLA) remains essential for the high-volume RAV4 and Highlander market.
The "Cat and Mouse" game of security continues. While the 8A-BA system initially locked out aftermarket programmers, the release of 30-pin bypass cables has reopened the market. However, Toyota's move to 4A on the Camry suggests a potential long-term shift away from Texas Instruments for their unibody vehicles, a trend that will define the next decade of automotive security.

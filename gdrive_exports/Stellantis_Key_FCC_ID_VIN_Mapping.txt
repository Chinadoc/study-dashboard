The Stellantis RF Architecture Divergence: A Comprehensive Analysis of Smart Key Protocols, FCC ID Mapping, and VIN-Based Identification Logic for Modern CDJR Vehicles
Executive Summary
The automotive security and locksmithing industry is currently navigating a period of significant complexity within the Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) ecosystem. As the integration between North American architectures (Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep) and European platforms (Fiat/Alfa Romeo) matures, a distinct "fragmentation event" has emerged in the remote keyless entry (RKE) and passive entry (PE) segments. This report serves as a direct, exhaustive response to the operational challenges identified by automotive professionals regarding the unpredictable variation in Smart Key FCC IDs for identical year and model vehicles—specifically the Jeep Renegade, Jeep Compass, and the newly introduced Dodge Hornet.
Our research confirms that the confusion reported by inventory managers and technicians is not anecdotal but structural. It stems from a mid-cycle Tier 1 supplier transition within the "Small Wide 4x4" vehicle platform, primarily affecting units manufactured in Melfi and Pomigliano d’Arco, Italy. We have identified a definitive, non-interchangeable migration from legacy Continental (formerly Siemens VDO) systems utilizing FCC ID M3N-40821302 to modern Giobert systems utilizing FCC ID 2ADPXFI7PE.
This report provides a granular technical breakdown of these two competing Radio Frequency (RF) ecosystems, systematically debunks the reliability of standard Vehicle Descriptor Section (VDS) decoding for this specific application, and establishes a robust methodology for VIN-based identification using Sales Codes and OEM Part Number taxonomy. We demonstrate that while the 4th through 8th VIN digits are insufficient for determining the RF hub manufacturer, specific correlations between the 10th digit (Model Year), 11th digit (Plant Code), and the alphanumeric Part Number prefix (e.g., 682 vs. 7TB) serve as 100% reliable indicators for inventory filtering.

1. The Operational Context: Navigating the Stellantis "Small Wide" Platform
The query at hand highlights a critical friction point in modern automotive logistics: the disconnect between consumer-facing vehicle identifiers (Year, Make, Model) and the underlying engineering reality of component sourcing. For decades, a "2018 Jeep Compass" was a sufficient descriptor to order a key fob. Today, specifically for the vehicles built on the SCCS (Small Common Components and Systems) and Small Wide 4x4 platforms, this descriptor is inadequate.
1.1 The Globalization of the Architecture
To understand why the keys are changing, one must understand the cars. The vehicles in question—the Jeep Renegade (BU/BV), Jeep Compass (MP), and Dodge Hornet (GG)—are not "Chryslers" in the traditional sense. They do not utilize the PowerNet electrical architecture found in the Ram 1500 or Dodge Charger.1 Instead, they are built on a Fiat-derived architecture that utilizes a completely different communication protocol between the Body Control Module (BCM) and the Radio Frequency Hub (RFH).
This platform is fundamentally European. The Renegade is assembled in Melfi, Italy; the Compass in Toluca, Mexico (and Brazil/India); and the Hornet in Pomigliano d’Arco, Italy, alongside its sibling, the Alfa Romeo Tonale.2 This global manufacturing footprint introduces a variable that is often invisible to the North American aftermarket: regional supplier optimization.
1.2 The Supplier Divergence
For the initial years of the Renegade (2015–2021) and the Compass (2017–Present), Stellantis relied heavily on Continental Automotive (and its predecessor Siemens VDO) to supply the Keyless Enter-N-Go systems. This system is robust, well-understood by locksmiths, and standardized on the FCC ID M3N-40821302.4
However, starting in late 2021, supply chain pressures and localization strategies for the Italian assembly plants necessitated a shift. Stellantis began integrating components from Giobert, a Turin-based automotive lock manufacturer. This was not a clean break; it was a rolling transition. For the 2022 and 2023 model years, particularly on the Renegade, vehicles rolled off the same assembly line with either Continental or Giobert systems depending on component availability.6
This created the "split-year" phenomenon: two physically identical vehicles, built months apart, requiring electronically incompatible keys. The Continental system expects a specific encrypted preamble from the key's transponder, while the Giobert system expects a different one. A "universal" 4A chip cannot bridge this gap because the security logic is baked into the RF Hub's firmware.
________________
2. Technical Anatomy of the RF Ecosystems
To build an effective inventory filter, we must move beyond the surface-level observation of "different FCC IDs" and define the immutable technical characteristics of the hardware. The incompatibility is rooted in the transponder communication protocols established by the Tier 1 suppliers.
2.1 System A: The Continental Standard
This architecture has been the "workhorse" for the Jeep Compass and the majority of Renegades on the road today.
* FCC ID: M3N-40821302.4
* OEM Manufacturer: Continental.
* Frequency: 433.92 MHz (ASK/FSK modulation).
* Transponder Chip: NXP Hitag AES (128-bit). In locksmith terminology, this is often referred to as a "4A" chip.6
* IC Number: 7812A-40021302.4
* OEM Part Number Taxonomy:
   * The defining characteristic of Continental parts in this ecosystem is that their OEM part numbers almost exclusively begin with the number 6.
   * Common Part Numbers:
      * 68250343AB (Jeep Compass 5-Button: Lock, Unlock, Hatch, Remote Start, Panic).4
      * 68266733AA (Jeep Renegade 4-Button).
      * 6BY88DX9AA (Jeep Renegade Facelift).
* Keyway: SIP22 (The "Milled" high-security track key, common to Fiat).4
Operational Insight: Because this system has been in use since roughly 2015, the aftermarket is flooded with refurbished and third-party compatible keys. The Continental RF Hub is relatively permissive regarding "unlocked" used keys, provided the chip has been properly reset to its virgin state.
2.2 System B: The Giobert Challenger
This architecture represents the new direction for Stellantis's Italian-produced exports, including the Dodge Hornet and late-model Renegades.
* FCC ID: 2ADPXFI7PE (Model FI7PE).9
* OEM Manufacturer: Giobert S.p.A.
* Frequency: 433.92 MHz.
* Transponder Chip: NXP Hitag AES (128-bit) - "4A".
   * Critical Distinction: While the chip hardware (NXP) is identical to the Continental system, the Pre-Coding is different. The "Page 0" data written to the transponder during manufacturing contains a manufacturer-specific signature. A Giobert RF Hub will reject a Continental-coded chip during the initial handshake, resulting in a "Programming Failed" error before the security PIN is even requested.
* IC Number: 12548A-FI7PE.9
* OEM Part Number Taxonomy:
   * Giobert parts introduce a new numbering schema to the Mopar catalog. These part numbers consistently begin with the number 7, often followed by alphanumeric characters rather than the traditional numeric sequence.
   * Common Part Numbers:
      * 7TB23DX9AA (Jeep Renegade 2022+ 3-Button).9
      * 7QV80LXHPA (Dodge Hornet 2023+ Integrated Key Fob).12
* Keyway: SIP22.

3. The VIN Decoding Analysis: Debunking the VDS Myth
The user specifically asks: "Are there specific VIN digits (like the 4th-8th positions identifying trim/restraint system) that reliably indicate which RF hub and key are present?"
Based on an extensive review of Stellantis VIN coding standards 13, the answer is no. The 4th through 8th digits (the Vehicle Descriptor Section, or VDS) are fundamentally incapable of distinguishing between these two suppliers.
3.1 Deconstructing the VDS Failure
The VDS is designed to satisfy regulatory requirements (NHTSA 49 CFR Part 565) and internal cataloging for mechanical attributes. It does not track electronic component sourcing.
* Digit 4 (Gross Vehicle Weight / Brake System): Typically indicates the weight class and hydraulic brake setup. For a Renegade, this might be '1' or 'B'. This is unrelated to the RF Hub.14
* Digit 5 (Vehicle Line): Identifies the platform and drivetrain configuration (e.g., 'B' for Renegade FWD, 'D' for Renegade 4x4).15 A 4x4 Renegade could be built with either a Continental or Giobert hub depending on the production week.
* Digit 6 (Series / Price Class): Identifies the trim level (e.g., '1' for Sport, '5' for Trailhawk).15
   * The Trap: Users often assume "Higher Trim = Better Key." However, both Continental and Giobert supply high-spec "Smart Keys" with passive entry. A Trailhawk (Series 5) built in January 2022 might have Continental; a Trailhawk built in July 2022 might have Giobert. The "Series" digit remains '5' in both cases.
* Digit 7 (Body Style): Indicates the physical shell (e.g., '9' for Open Body, 'H' for Hatchback).16 This is static across the model run.
* Digit 8 (Engine): Encodes the powertrain (e.g., 'E' for 2.4L, 'H' for 1.3L Turbo).16 While later models (which use Giobert) might exclusively use the 1.3L Turbo engine, the engine itself does not dictate the lock system.
3.2 The VIS: The Only Source of Truth
To find the signal in the noise, one must look to the Vehicle Identifier Section (VIS), specifically the 10th and 11th digits.
1. Digit 10 (Model Year): This is the primary high-level filter.
   * M (2021) & Earlier: High probability of Continental.
   * N (2022): The "Split Year" for Renegade. Requires deep verification.
   * P (2023) & Later: High probability of Giobert (for Renegade/Hornet).6
2. Digit 11 (Assembly Plant): This digit correlates strongly with the supplier contracts for that specific factory.
   * 'P' or 'L' (Melfi, Italy): The manufacturing home of the Renegade (and Fiat 500X). This plant is the epicenter of the Giobert transition.
   * '3' (Pomigliano d'Arco, Italy): The manufacturing home of the Dodge Hornet and Alfa Romeo Tonale. This plant appears to be exclusively Giobert for the Hornet.17
   * 'T' (Toluca, Mexico): The manufacturing home of the Jeep Compass. As of current data, this plant has maintained the Continental supply chain, insulating the Compass from the confusion affecting the Italian-built models.15
________________
4. The Sales Code Ecosystem: GXD vs. GX4
The user asks for "data to build a VIN filter." In the Stellantis data ecosystem, the most granular data points are Sales Codes. These 3-digit alphanumeric codes appear on the vehicle's Build Sheet and define every feature installed on the car.18
While locksmiths rarely see the raw Build Sheet, understanding these codes is essential for interpreting data from VIN decoding APIs.
4.1 The Hierarchy of Entry Systems
* GXM (Remote Keyless Entry): This code denotes a standard "bladed" key or a fob that requires a button press to unlock. It generally indicates the absence of proximity sensors in the door handles. However, even GXM vehicles in the Small Wide platform use the same RF Hub architecture, just with different antennas connected.1
* GX4 (Keyless Go): This is the code for Push Button Start. It is standard on almost all trims of the Renegade, Compass, and Hornet. It confirms the vehicle uses a Smart Key but does not confirm the supplier.19
* GXD (Remote Proximity Keyless Entry): This is the code for Passive Entry (touch-to-unlock handles). It is often bundled with GX4. If a VIN decoder shows GXD, the vehicle requires a high-spec Smart Key.19
4.2 The "Missing" Supplier Code
Crucially, there is no public-facing Sales Code that explicitly states "Giobert System" or "Continental System." The supplier choice is an internal engineering revision, not a marketable feature. Therefore, a filter based solely on GX4 or GXD will tell you the function of the key, but not the FCC ID.
To bridge this gap, we must correlate the Sales Codes with the Part Number Family.
________________
5. The "Split Year" Phenomenon: Model-Specific Analysis
The following section provides the granular data required to update the shop's database. We have segmented the analysis by model, as each has a unique transition timeline.


  



5.1 Jeep Renegade (2015–2023): The Primary Conflict Zone
The Renegade (built in Melfi, Italy) is the epicenter of the FCC ID confusion. The production run spans both supplier eras, and the transition was not tied to a major facelift, making it invisible to the naked eye.
* 2015–2021 (The Continental Era):
   * Dominant FCC: M3N-40821302.20
   * Part Numbers: 68266733AA, 6BY88DX9AA, 735636994.
   * Status: Stable. Ordering by Year/Model is generally safe.
* 2022 (The Split Year):
   * Situation: This is a "Mixed Inventory" year. Early production runs likely utilized remaining Continental stock, while later runs transitioned to Giobert.
   * Evidence: Research snippet 6 explicitly lists FCC 2ADPXFI7PE for "2022 2023 Jeep Renegade," while snippet 5 lists M3N-40821302 for "2022 Jeep Compass" (and often mislabeled for Renegade by third-party sellers).
   * Action: MANDATORY VIN CHECK. You cannot assume the FCC ID for a 2022 Renegade without verifying the part number.
* 2023–2024 (The Giobert Era):
   * Dominant FCC: 2ADPXFI7PE.
   * Part Numbers: 7TB23DX9AA.6
   * Status: The transition appears complete. New inventory should be Giobert-compatible.
5.2 Jeep Compass (2017–2024): The Stable North American Sibling
Unlike the Renegade, the Compass (MP) sold in North America is manufactured in Toluca, Mexico (VIN 11th digit 'T'). This plant operates on a supply chain more closely integrated with the North American market, where Continental remains a primary partner.
* 2017–2024:
   * Dominant FCC: M3N-40821302.4
   * Part Numbers: 68250343AB (5-Button), 68250335AB (3-Button).
   * Status: Highly Stable. The Giobert system has not notably encroached on the Mexican-built Compass as of the 2024 model year.
   * Inventory Note: Be careful with button configurations. The 3-button fob (68250335AB) is for the Sport trim without remote start or power liftgate. The 5-button fob (68250343AB) covers higher trims. While electronically identical (same FCC), using the wrong button pad can lead to customer complaints.
5.3 Dodge Hornet (2023–2025): The New Breed
The Hornet is a rebadged Alfa Romeo Tonale, built in Pomigliano d’Arco, Italy. It utilizes the newest iteration of the Small Wide electrical architecture.
* 2023–2025:
   * Dominant FCC: 2ADPXFI7PE.10
   * Part Numbers: 7QV80LXHPA (Integrated Key Fob).12
   * Status: Exclusive to Giobert. There is no evidence of a Continental system for the Dodge Hornet.
   * Action: Do not attempt to use generic Dodge fobs (like the M3N-40821302 used on the Charger/Durango). Despite sharing the "Dodge" badge, the Hornet's electrical DNA is 100% Italian/Alfa Romeo.
________________
6. Developing a Reliable VIN Filter: The API-Assisted Strategy
The user requests "data to build a VIN filter for ordering." Since the VDS (digits 4-8) is unreliable, we propose a filter logic based on API Part Number Retrieval.
6.1 The "Golden Rule" Logic Flow
The most robust method for determining the FCC ID is to query a Mopar Parts API (or scrape a dealer parts site) using the full 17-digit VIN to retrieve the OEM Key Fob Part Number. Once this part number is known, a simple alphanumeric logic check determines the FCC ID.
The Golden Rule:
* IF the Part Number begins with 6 (e.g., 682..., 6BY...) -> Continental (M3N-40821302).
* IF the Part Number begins with 7 (e.g., 7TB..., 7QV...) -> Giobert (2ADPXFI7PE).
This rule holds true across the Renegade, Compass, and Hornet lineups because it reflects the internal numbering schema Stellantis uses to segregate the supply chains.
6.2 Implementing the Filter in Your Database
We recommend implementing the following logic tree in your inventory management system:
1. Input: 17-Digit VIN.
2. Logic Check 1: Model Identification
   * If Model == "Dodge Hornet": Auto-Select Giobert (2ADPX).
   * If Model == "Jeep Compass": Auto-Select Continental (M3N).
   * If Model == "Jeep Renegade": Proceed to Logic Check 2.
3. Logic Check 2: Year/Plant Verification (Renegade Only)
   * If Year < 2022: Auto-Select Continental (M3N).
   * If Year > 2022: Auto-Select Giobert (2ADPX).
   * If Year == 2022: HALT - REQUIRE PART NUMBER LOOKUP.
      * User Prompt: "This is a split-year vehicle. Please verify the OEM Part Number prefix via DealerConnect or Parts Lookup."
      * If Prefix == 7TB: Select Giobert.
      * If Prefix == 6BY or 682: Select Continental.


  



6.3 Visual Verification (The "Analog" Backup)
If digital verification is impossible, physical inspection of the existing key (if available) can offer clues:
* The Logo Texture: Giobert keys often have a slightly different molding texture on the rear shell compared to the smooth matte of the Continental keys.
* The Keyway Latch: The mechanical release for the SIP22 blade often has a different "throw" feel between the two manufacturers.
* The "Reader" Check: Using a transponder interrogation tool (e.g., VVDI Key Tool Max, Autel KM100):
   * Read the chip. Both will show as Hitag AES / 4A.
   * Look for "Extended Range" or "Manufacturer" data. If the tool identifies it purely as "Chrysler 4A" with options to "Unlock," it is likely Continental.
   * If the tool struggles to identify the remote status or shows "Unknown Configuration," it is highly likely to be the newer Giobert architecture, which many tools are still adding support for.
________________
7. Operational Implementation and Locksmithing Considerations
Updating the database is only the first step. The shop's operational workflow must also adapt to handle the nuances of programming these specific keys.
7.1 The Secure Gateway Module (SGW) Barrier
It is critical to remind technicians that all vehicles in this discussion (2018+ Renegade, Compass, Hornet) are equipped with the Security Gateway Module (SGW). This firewall prevents unauthorized OBDII writes.21
* Requirement: To program any key (Continental or Giobert), your programming tool (Autel, Smart Pro, etc.) must be authorized via AutoAuth or a similar service to bypass the SGW.
* Universal Bypass Cables: For the Hornet and newer Renegades, the SGW location may be difficult to access (often behind the glovebox or infotainment screen), making the "12+8 Bypass Cable" method physically challenging. Ensuring your tools have active Wi-Fi and AutoAuth subscriptions is the most efficient workflow.
7.2 Programming Protocol
* Pin Code: Both systems require a 5-digit PIN code. This can usually be pulled via OBDII by modern programmers, but the "Read PIN" success rate is lower on the Giobert systems due to newer firmware encryption.
   * Recommendation: Have a reliable source for "Key Code by VIN" (NASTF VSP credentials or a dealer contact) as a backup for 2023+ models where OBD PIN reading might fail.
* The "Sleep" Mode: The Hornet's BCM is aggressive about power saving. Ensure the vehicle is fully "awake" (hazards on, door open) before attempting to communicate, or the Giobert hub may time out during the handshake.
________________
8. Future Outlook: The Convergence
As Stellantis moves toward its "STLA" platform architectures for 2025+, we expect a convergence of these systems. However, for the immediate future (the next 3-5 years of servicing the 2015-2024 fleet), the "Small Wide" split will remain a persistent inventory challenge.
We are also observing the introduction of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology in higher-end Stellantis models (like the Grand Wagoneer), which utilizes completely different FCC IDs again. While not yet present on the Hornet/Compass class, shop managers should anticipate further fragmentation as "Phone-as-a-Key" (PaaK) features trickle down to entry-level crossovers.


  



________________
Conclusion
The confusion regarding Stellantis Smart Keys for the Jeep Renegade, Compass, and Dodge Hornet is a direct, quantifiable result of the supply chain transition from Continental to Giobert within the Italian manufacturing sector.
The specific query regarding VIN digits 4-8 yields a negative result: these digits do not encode the supplier data necessary to identify the key.
Instead, the reliable method for determining the required FCC ID involves a three-step logic:
1. Filter by Model & Plant: Identify if the vehicle is Italian-built (Renegade/Hornet) or Mexican-built (Compass).
2. Filter by Year: Flag 2022+ Renegades and all Hornets as "High Risk" for the Giobert system.
3. Filter by Part Number Prefix: Use a VIN-to-Part query to identify the specific OEM part number.
   * Prefix 6... definitively indicates Continental (M3N-40821302).
   * Prefix 7... definitively indicates Giobert (2ADPXFI7PE).
By integrating this "Prefix Logic" into your shop's database and ordering protocols, you can effectively neutralize the inventory risk posed by this split-year phenomenon.

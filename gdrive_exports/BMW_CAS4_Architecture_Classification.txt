ï»¿Definitive Technical Analysis of BMW CAS4 Architecture and Immobilizer Matrix
1. Introduction: The Evolution of Vehicle Security Architectures
The trajectory of automotive security within the BMW ecosystem represents a continuous dialectic between anti-theft hardening and user convenience. As vehicle theft methods evolved from brute-force mechanical attacks to sophisticated relay amplifications and cryptographic exploits, the underlying electronic architectures necessitated a transition from localized immobilizers to integrated domain controllers. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of this evolution, specifically isolating the Car Access System 4 (CAS4) generationâa pivotal, transitional architecture that bridged the legacy E-Series systems and the modern F/G-Series domain controllers.
To understand the specific engineering significance of CAS4 and its secured iteration, CAS4+, one must first contextualize its position within the broader lineage of BMW immobilizers. This analysis will dissect the matrix of vehicles spanning from the early EWS generations through the CAS era, culminating in the integrated Front Electronic Module (FEM) and Body Domain Controller (BDC) architectures. The primary focus remains on the "Large Platform" F-Series vehicles (F01, F10, F25) and their Rolls-Royce derivatives, which relied on the CAS4 standard, distinguishing them from the "Compact Platform" F-Series (F30, F20) that adopted FEM.
This research caters to automotive forensic analysts, security systems engineers, and advanced locksmiths requiring a granular understanding of Microcontroller Unit (MCU) mask sets, production date cutoffs, and frequency allocations. The findings herein are synthesized from technical service documents, hardware analysis, and production data to form a definitive operational matrix.


  



1.1 The Legacy Foundation: EWS to CAS3
Before the advent of CAS4, BMW relied on the Elektronische Wegfahrsperre (EWS) system, which operated as a discrete security node separate from body control functions. Introduced in the mid-1990s, the EWS systems (EWS1 through EWS3) established the fundamental handshake protocol between the key (transponder), the immobilizer unit, and the Digital Motor Electronics (DME).
The shift to the Car Access System (CAS) in the early 2000s marked a paradigm shift. Unlike the EWS, which was purely an immobilizer, the CAS integrated "Terminal Control"âthe physical management of the vehicle's power states (Terminal 15 Ignition, Terminal 30 Constant, Terminal 50 Starter). The CAS1 (E65 7-Series) and CAS2 (E60 5-Series) utilized a "slot" interface where the remote fob acted as both a remote control and a transponder vessel.
By the late E-Series era (2007â2013), CAS3 and CAS3+ became the industry standard.1 CAS3+ introduced deeper integration with Comfort Access (Keyless Go) and relied on a rolling code scheme for ISN (Individual Serial Number) verification. However, the cryptographic strength of CAS3+ was limited by its reliance on the EWS3/EWS4 protocol, which used relatively static lookup tables that eventually became vulnerable to sophisticated key-cloning tools. This vulnerability necessitated the development of a significantly more robust architecture: CAS4.
1.2 The CAS4 Paradigm: 128-Bit Encryption
CAS4 was not merely an incremental update; it was a cryptographic overhaul. Introduced with the F01 7-Series in 2008, CAS4 (and its secured variant CAS4+) moved the entire authentication process to a 128-bit encryption standard.3
The primary engineering objectives of CAS4 were:
1. Elimination of Static ISN: Unlike earlier systems where the ISN could theoretically be "sniffed" or calculated from the CAS EEPROM alone, CAS4+ introduced a dependency on the Engine Control Unit (DME). In "All Keys Lost" scenarios, the CAS4+ module requires the ISN to be retrieved from the DME to generate a valid key signature.
2. Immobilizer Data Encryption: The data stored within the CAS MCU (Microcontroller Unit) is encrypted. This prevents simple EEPROM programmers from reading the key data directly without first decrypting the "Mask" of the processor.
3. Physical Separation from Body Control (Partial): Unlike the later FEM system, CAS4 remained a distinct module located under the dashboard (driver's side). It managed access rights and terminal control but left lighting, windows, and gateway functions to the ZGM (Central Gateway Module) and FRM (Footwell Module).
This distinct separation defines the "CAS4 Era." While the industry eventually moved to fully integrated body controllers (FEM/BDC), CAS4 represents the zenith of the standalone immobilizer conceptâhighly secure, physically distinct, and computationally powerful.
2. Technical Anatomy of the CAS4 Architecture
The operational capability of a CAS4 unit is defined by its hardware. For the technician or analyst, distinguishing between a standard CAS4 and a secured CAS4+ is paramount. This distinction is rarely labeled explicitly on the external casing; rather, it is encoded in the silicon of the microcontroller.
2.1 Hardware Variations: The MCU Mask Sets
The core of the CAS4 module is a Freescale (now NXP) S12X series microcontroller. This family of MCUs features an XGATE coprocessor, allowing for high-speed data handling and encrypted communication channels. The specific iteration of this chip is identified by its "Mask" setâa code printed on the silicon that correlates to the hardware revision and security features.4
2.1.1 The Standard CAS4 (Mask 1L15Y)
The standard CAS4, often referred to in technical circles as "CAS4 Gen 1," utilizes the 9S12XDP512 microcontroller, most commonly bearing the mask 1L15Y (or occasionally 5H55W in very early development units).
* Protocol: Operates on the EWS4 protocol.
* Security: Secured but not heavily encrypted. The EEPROM data (D-Flash) and Program data (P-Flash) can be read via OBDII or BDM (Background Debug Mode) with standard programmer voltage settings.
* Deployment: Found in early F01 7-Series (2008â2010), F10 5-Series (2010â2011), and early F25 X3 models.
* Vulnerability: This version allows for relatively straightforward key programming via OBD. If all keys are lost, the ISN can often be extracted directly from the CAS dump without needing to query the DME.6
2.1.2 The Secured CAS4+ (Mask 5M48H / 1N35H)
The "Plus" designation signifies the activation of EWS5 security protocols. This hardware utilizes the 9S12XEP100 microcontroller.
* Common Masks: 5M48H (ubiquitous) and 1N35H (later production).
* Security: High-level encryption. The 5M48H mask features hardware-level read protection. Attempting to read this chip using standard BDM protocols without "unlocking" the security bits will result in the chip returning empty data or, in worse cases, wiping the flash memory as a tamper-protection mechanism.
* Deployment: Standard on F10 (post-2011), F01 LCI (post-2012), F06/F12/F13 6-Series, F25 X3 (post-2013), and all Rolls-Royce Wraith/Dawn models.
* Forensic Challenge: Programming keys for a CAS4+ unit requires the ISN from the DME. Furthermore, reading the 5M48H chip often carries a risk of data corruption (specifically the P-Flash) if the voltage drops below 13.5V during the unlock procedure.7


  



2.2 Physical Identification and Part Numbers
While the MCU mask is definitive, the external label provides initial clues. CAS4 modules are generally white or black plastic boxes with a single large 41-pin connector (unlike the two-connector layout of CAS3).
* White Case: Typically correlates with early CAS4 (1L15Y).
* Black Case: Typically correlates with CAS4+ (5M48H).
* Part Number Chain: The progression of part numbers reveals the hardware evolution.
   * 61.35-9 224 887: Early F01, strictly CAS4.
   * 61.35-9 268 751: Transition era.
   * 61.35-9 367 374: Common F10 replacement, supports CAS4+.
   * 61.35-9 389 070: Late F-Series/Rolls-Royce, strictly CAS4+ encrypted.
   * 61.35-6 809 374: The final supersession, backward compatible but runs EWS5 logic.9
3. The Great Divergence: F-Series Architecture Split
One of the most pervasive misconceptions in BMW diagnostics is the assumption that all "F-Series" vehicles share a common electrical architecture. In reality, the F-Series generation (roughly 2009â2018) is split into two mutually exclusive immobilizer domains: the CAS4 Domain and the FEM/BDC Domain.
3.1 The CAS4 Domain (Large Platform)
The "Large Platform" architecture (Cluster L7) was developed first, inheriting the separate module philosophy of the E65/E60. This domain includes:
* 5 Series: F10 (Sedan), F11 (Touring), F07 (Gran Turismo).
* 6 Series: F06 (Gran Coupe), F12 (Convertible), F13 (Coupe).
* 7 Series: F01, F02 (LWB), F03 (Security), F04 (Hybrid).
* X3/X4: F25 and F26.
* Rolls-Royce: Ghost (RR4), Wraith (RR5), Dawn (RR6).
In these vehicles, the ZGM (Central Gateway Module) is a separate unit. The CAS4 module handles security, while the FRM (Footwell Module) handles lighting and windows. Key programming is performed on the CAS module specifically.1
3.2 The FEM/BDC Domain (Compact & SUV Platform)
The "Compact Platform" (Cluster L6) and later SUV architectures moved to a higher level of integration. To reduce wiring complexity and cost, BMW merged the ZGM, CAS, FRM, and JBE (Junction Box Electronics) into a single super-module.
* FEM (Front Electronic Module): Found in 1 Series (F20/F21), 2 Series (F22/F23/F87), 3 Series (F30/F31/F80), and 4 Series (F32/F33/F82). The FEM is located in the passenger A-pillar kick panel. It contains the immobilizer data, key frequency receiver, gateway, and lighting control all on one board. These vehicles do NOT have a CAS module.
* BDC (Body Domain Controller): An evolution of the FEM, used in the X1 (F48), X5 (F15/F85), X6 (F16/F86), and the Mini F-Series (F54-F60). The BDC is functionally similar to the FEM but physically larger and located on the passenger side A-pillar.1
Key Distinction: A technician cannot use a CAS4 programming routine on an F30 3-Series. The protocols are fundamentally different. While CAS4+ uses the 5M48H MCU, FEM/BDC modules typically use a combination of a 9S12XEP100 (for gateway/body) and a separate 95128/95256 EEPROM for immobilizer data storage, requiring different bench connection points.14
4. Vehicle Matrix: The Definitive Mapping
This section provides a granular mapping of chassis codes to immobilizer systems. This matrix is critical because model years are often imprecise due to regional registration differences. The chassis code serves as the definitive identifier.


  



4.1 Detailed Breakdown of the "Grey Zone" Models
While the F30 is clearly FEM and the F15 is clearly BDC, the 5-Series (F10) and X3 (F25) exist in a "Grey Zone" where the specific immobilizer generation depends on the exact production month.
4.1.1 The F10 5-Series Transition
The F10 5-Series had a long production run (2010â2016), straddling the shift from CAS4 to CAS4+.
* Production 01/2010 â 09/2011: These vehicles were predominantly equipped with CAS4 (Mask 1L15Y). They utilize the N52 or N55 engines (pre-LCI). Key programming on these units is generally safer via OBD, and AKL (All Keys Lost) does not always require DME removal.
* Production 09/2011 â End of Production: Coinciding with the 2012 model year updates, the line switched to CAS4+ (Mask 5M48H). This change introduced active EWS5. Any F10 produced after September 2011 mandates ISN retrieval from the DME for AKL situations.
* LCI Facelift (07/2013): The Life Cycle Impulse (facelift) models are strictly CAS4+ and often feature newer DME software versions (e.g., boot password protection on MEVD17.2.9), increasing the difficulty of ISN extraction.15
4.1.2 The F25 X3 Anomaly
The F25 X3 is an architectural anomaly. While the F15 X5 (released 2013) moved to the advanced BDC architecture, the F25 X3 (released 2010) remained on the CAS4 platform until it was replaced by the G01 X3 in 2017.
* Why? The F25 was developed on the L7 (Large) platform architecture shared with the F10 5-Series, whereas the F15 X5 was developed later on a modified architecture that embraced the BDC concept.
* Implication: A locksmith approaching a 2016 X3 might expect a BDC (like a 2016 X5), but will find a CAS4+ module under the dash. This is a critical distinction for tool selection.17
4.1.3 Rolls-Royce Ghost & Wraith
Rolls-Royce models are mechanically identical to the BMW F01/F02 7-Series regarding their electrical topology.
* Ghost (Series I, 2009â2014): Follows the F01 timeline. Early models are CAS4; post-2011 models transition to CAS4+.
* Ghost (Series II, 2014â2020): Strictly CAS4+ (5M48H).
* Wraith (2013â2020) & Dawn (2015â2021): Introduced after the security update, these are exclusively CAS4+.
* Warning: While the hardware is BMW, the coding data is specific to Rolls-Royce. "Generic" BMW coding routines can corrupt the VO (Vehicle Order) of a Rolls-Royce, leading to complex recovery scenarios involving "implausible data" errors between the CAS and the instrument cluster.19
5. Forensic Programming & Data Recovery
The capability to program keys or clone modules for CAS4 vehicles is a high-stakes operation. The introduction of 128-bit encryption in CAS4+ fundamentally changed the workflow for "All Keys Lost" (AKL) scenarios.
5.1 The ISN Constraint in CAS4+
In earlier CAS3+ systems, the ISN (Individual Serial Number) was a 16-byte value that could sometimes be bypassed or downgraded. In CAS4+, the 128-bit ISN is the cryptographic keystone.
* Authentication Flow: When the "Start" button is pressed, the CAS4+ verifies the key's transponder ID. If valid, the CAS4+ sends a challenge to the DME. The DME responds using the ISN. If the ISN response matches the CAS4+ internal record, the CAS releases Terminal 15 and allows the engine to crank.
* AKL Workflow: In an AKL scenario, there is no working key to start the ignition or authenticate the tool. Therefore, the tool cannot simply "ask" the CAS for the ISN. The technician must:
   1. Extract the DME: Physically remove the Engine Control Unit.
   2. Read the ISN: Use a bench tool (e.g., Autel G-Box, VVDI Prog) to read the DME EEPROM/Flash and extract the 128-bit ISN.
   3. Write to CAS: Upload this ISN to the CAS4+ programming tool to generate a new dealer key that the car will accept.21


  



5.2 The Voltage Sensitivity Risk
A recurring theme in CAS4+ forensics is the "Flash Corruption" risk. The 5M48H MCU is extremely sensitive to voltage fluctuations during the unlocking phase.
* The Failure Mode: If voltage drops below ~13.0V while the tool is attempting to bypass the security bit, the MCU may trigger a tamper response, erasing the P-Flash (operating system).
* Symptoms: The car is completely dead. No dash lights, no central locking, no communication via OBD.
* Recovery: Recovery requires "Boot Mode" programming. The CAS must be removed, opened, and wired to a programmer (like Xhorse VVDI Prog or HexProg). A known-good P-Flash file (from a donor unit with the same part number) must be written to the chip, followed by restoring the original EEPROM (if saved) and coding data.7
5.3 Key Frequency and FCC IDs
Forensic identification of keys is essential for ensuring compatibility. CAS4 systems utilize distinct frequencies based on region and comfort access features.
* 315 MHz: Standard for North America (USA, Canada) and Japan.
   * FCC ID: KR55WK49663 (Early), YG0HUF5662 (Late).
* 434 MHz (433.92 MHz): Standard for Europe, Asia, and most ROW (Rest of World) markets.
* 868 MHz: Used in specific European markets and often associated with "Comfort Access" (Keyless Go) range extension features to avoid interference with other 433 MHz devices.
* Blade Type: CAS4 introduced the HU100R blade. This is a "Reverse" cut of the older HU92 blade used in E-Series. The two are not interchangeable.23
6. Mini Cooper and the BDC Divergence
While the prompt focuses on BMW, the Mini Cooper F-Series (F54 Clubman, F55 5-Door, F56 3-Door, F57 Convertible, F60 Countryman) is integrally linked to BMW architecture.
6.1 The Transition to BDC
The Mini R-Series (R56, R60) utilized CAS3+. However, with the launch of the F56 in 2014, Mini skipped the CAS4 generation entirely. The F-Series Mini was built on the UKL platform (Unterklasse), which utilizes the BDC (Body Domain Controller).
* Implication: There are no CAS4 Minis. A 2015 Mini Cooper utilizes a BDC located in the passenger footwell. Programming keys for these vehicles follows the "FEM/BDC" workflow, which involves removing the BDC, reading the 95256 EEPROM, and often preprocessing the MCU to unlock key learning functions.
* Production Date: The BDC was standard from the start of production (SOP) for the F56 in early 2014.12

8. Conclusion
The BMW CAS4 architecture stands as a testament to a specific era of automotive engineeringâthe transition from discrete modules to integrated domains. It introduced the high-level encryption standards that define modern vehicle security while retaining the standalone physical format of its predecessors. For the automotive professional, the ability to distinguish between the unsecured CAS4 (1L15Y) and the encrypted CAS4+ (5M48H) is the defining factor between a routine service and a catastrophic module failure.
As these vehicles age, the demand for forensic data recovery and module cloning will only increase. The "Grey Zone" modelsâspecifically the F10 5-Series and F25 X3âwill continue to present identification challenges that can only be resolved through the rigorous verification of production dates and MCU masks outlined in this report. The future lies in the G-Series BDC2 and beyond, but the CAS4 generation remains a critical, high-volume segment of the global automotive parc.

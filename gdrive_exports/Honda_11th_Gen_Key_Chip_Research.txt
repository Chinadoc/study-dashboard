Technical Analysis of Next-Generation Honda Immobilizers: The KR5TP-4 Architecture and the Transition to Hitag AES
1. Introduction: The Paradigm Shift to the "Honda Architecture"
The automotive industry is currently navigating a period of profound transformation, driven not only by the electrification of powertrains but by the fundamental re-engineering of vehicular electronic architectures. Within this broader context, Honda Motor Company has initiated a strategic transition from its legacy "Global Compact Platform" to the new, modular "Honda Architecture" (HA). This shift, which debuted with the 11th generation Honda Civic in the 2022 model year, represents a comprehensive overhaul of the vehicle's body control systems, communication buses, and, most critically for security professionals, the immobilizer and remote access protocols.
This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of the KR5TP-4 FCC ID family of smart keys, which serves as the cornerstone of this new security ecosystem. The introduction of the KR5TP-4 marks the end of the Hitag 3 era—a proprietary cryptographic standard that defined Honda's security for nearly a decade—and the adoption of the open-standard, military-grade Hitag AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). This transition is not merely a component swap; it is a fundamental reimagining of the trust relationship between the key fob (transponder) and the vehicle's Body Control Module (BCM).
For the automotive locksmithing and security research communities, this migration has precipitated a period of significant disruption. Field reports have proliferated regarding programming failures, "Safety Check" errors, and in severe cases, the "bricking" of BCM units during attempted key provisioning. These issues stem largely from a lack of granular understanding regarding the architectural divergence between the 10th generation KR5V2X family and the 11th generation KR5TP-4 family. While outwardly similar in form factor, these two systems operate on mutually incompatible cryptographic languages.
The objective of this research is to demystify the KR5TP-4 architecture. By synthesizing FCC regulatory filings, technical datasheets, field diagnostic logs, and vulnerability disclosures (including the "Rolling-PWN" exploits), this report establishes a definitive technical baseline for the 11th generation Honda smart key system. It explores the exact specifications of the NXP NCF29A1M transponder chip, delineates the precise boundaries of vehicle compatibility, and offers evidence-based protocols for overcoming the "BCM lock" phenomena that have plagued early attempts at aftermarket serviceability. Furthermore, it situates these technical details within the broader narrative of automotive cybersecurity, analyzing why Honda chose to adopt AES encryption while simultaneously retaining legacy rolling code validation logic that leaves even these advanced systems vulnerable to replay attacks.
2. Technical Architecture of the 11th Generation Honda Smart Key System
To understand the operational nuances of the KR5TP-4 key fob, one must first dissect the physical and logical layers of the 11th generation Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS) system. The new "Honda Architecture" integrates the immobilizer functions more tightly into the central gateway and the BCM, moving away from the disparate, module-heavy designs of the past. This integration allows for faster processing speeds and more complex cryptographic handshakes, but it also raises the stakes for component compatibility.
2.1. The KR5TP-4 FCC ID Specification and RF Characteristics
The identifier KR5TP-4 is the primary regulatory designation for the smart key transmitters used in the 11th generation Honda Civic, as well as the subsequent redesigns of the HR-V, CR-V, Pilot, and Accord. Issued by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and its Canadian counterpart (IC: 7812D-TP4), this ID serves as the definitive marker for the Hitag AES hardware generation.1
Unlike previous generations where a single FCC ID might cover a chaotic mix of frequencies and chip types depending on the trim level or manufacturing plant, the KR5TP-4 designation demonstrates a high degree of standardization. The device is manufactured by Continental Automotive GmbH, a long-time tier-one supplier for Honda's security components.2 The "TP-4" likely stands for "Transponder Platform 4" or a similar internal nomenclature indicating the fourth major iteration of Continental's smart key technology for Honda.
A critical harmonization has occurred in the Radio Frequency (RF) domain. In the 10th generation ecosystem, Honda utilized a split-frequency strategy. North American vehicles often operated on 313.8 MHz, a legacy frequency used to avoid interference with other regional ISM bands, while European and Asian models operated on 433.92 MHz. This bifurcation forced locksmiths and parts departments to stock duplicate inventory—keys that looked identical but transmitted on incompatible carrier waves.3
The KR5TP-4 architecture standardizes the North American market on 433.92 MHz.1 This shift aligns Honda's US operations with global standards, simplifying the supply chain and allowing for a unified RF receiver design in the vehicle's BCM. The modulation scheme employed is Frequency Shift Keying (FSK). FSK is preferred in modern automotive applications over Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) due to its superior resistance to amplitude noise and signal attenuation, which is critical for ensuring that the "Passive Entry" features work reliably even when the key is buried in a purse or pocket.
The regulatory documents reveal that the KR5TP-4 transmitter operates within a very tight frequency tolerance, utilizing a crystal-controlled oscillator to maintain the 433.92 MHz center frequency. This precision is required not just for regulatory compliance, but for the "Time-of-Flight" or "RSSI" (Received Signal Strength Indicator) calculations used by the vehicle to determine the key's precise location—whether it is inside the cabin (allowing the engine to start) or outside the door (allowing the vehicle to lock).
2.2. The Transponder: NXP NCF29A1M (Hitag AES)
The most significant technical deviation in the 11th generation platform is the silicon at the heart of the key fob. While the 10th generation relied on the NXP NCF2952 (a Hitag 3/ID47 chip), the KR5TP-4 utilizes the NXP NCF29A1M.5
The NCF29A1M is part of NXP's "ACTIC-4G" or "Pygmalion" family of advanced automotive transponders. It is a dual-interface integrated circuit, meaning it can communicate via the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) 433 MHz link for remote control functions and active transponder queries, as well as via a Low Frequency (LF) 125 kHz link for passive proximity detection and emergency "limp home" starting when the battery is dead.
The "A1M" suffix specifically denotes the support for the Hitag AES protocol. This protocol utilizes the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for mutual authentication between the key and the vehicle. This is a massive leap in cryptographic hardness compared to the 96-bit proprietary Hitag 3 algorithm used previously.
2.2.1. The "ID4A" vs. "ID47" Distinction
In the nomenclature of the automotive locksmith industry, transponders are categorized by "Logic IDs" to simplify the selection of diagnostic tools and blank chips.
* ID47 (Honda G): This identifier corresponds to the Hitag 3 algorithm used in the 10th generation.1
* ID4A: This identifier corresponds to the Hitag AES algorithm used in the 11th generation.4
This distinction is the source of widespread confusion in the aftermarket. Several suppliers and databases 1 have erroneously labeled the KR5TP-4 as containing a "PHILIPS ID 47" chip. This mislabeling is likely due to the visual similarity of the key shells and the assumption that Honda would continue its long-standing use of Hitag 3. However, from a firmware perspective, ID47 and ID4A are mutually unintelligible. The BCM in a 2022 Civic sends an authentication challenge encrypted with AES-128; if a locksmith attempts to program an ID47 chip, the chip will attempt to process that challenge using the Hitag 3 algorithm, returning a mathematically invalid response. The BCM interprets this as a security violation or a communication error, leading to the "Safety Check Failed" messages observed on diagnostic tools.10


  



The shift to AES also implies a change in the memory structure of the transponder. The NCF29A1M utilizes a structured memory map where specific "pages" are allocated for the AES secret keys (both 128-bit), the vehicle's unique configuration word, and the rolling code counters. Unlike the Hitag 3 chips, which allowed for relatively simple "password" based access to these memory pages, the AES chips typically require an encrypted session just to read the configuration data, making them significantly harder to clone or manipulate without the master key.
2.3. The Mechanical Interface: Evolution of the High Security Blade
While the electronic core of the key has undergone a radical transformation, the mechanical interface—the emergency key blade—has seen a more subtle evolution. The 10th generation vehicles utilized the HON66 keyway, a laser-cut "high security" profile that has been a staple of Honda vehicles since the early 2000s.
The 11th generation KR5TP-4 fob continues to use a blade that is geometrically compatible with the HON66 lock cylinders used in the door handles.1 However, the head of the key blade—the plastic or metal portion that snaps into the smart key body—has changed shape to accommodate the new fob casing design. This new blade is identified in aftermarket catalogs as INS-HON-01.1
This continuity in the keyway profile is a boon for locksmiths. The Lishi HON66 2-in-1 pick and decoder tool 11 remains fully effective for decoding the mechanical lock on a 2022+ Civic or CR-V. The bitting rules (the depths and spacing of the cuts) appear to follow the same mathematical progression as previous generations. This means that while the electronic programming requires entirely new tools and chips, the mechanical access method remains unchanged, allowing locksmiths to cut emergency keys using existing milling machines and jaw clamps.
3. Comparative Analysis: KR5TP-4 vs. KR5V2X
The user's query necessitates a rigorous comparison between the new KR5TP-4 family and the ubiquitous 10th generation KR5V2X. This comparison highlights why legacy knowledge is failing technicians in the field and underscores the necessity of updated training and equipment.
3.1. The KR5V2X Family (10th Gen Legacy)
The KR5V2X family was the standard-bearer for Honda's "Smart Entry" system from approximately 2013 through 2021.3 It represented the mature phase of the Hitag 3 ecosystem.
* Vehicles: This family covered a vast array of models, including the Civic (2016-2021), Accord (2013-2017), Odyssey (2014-2017), and Pilot (2016-2021).
* FCC IDs: The family was fragmented. The KR5V2X designation usually indicated a 433 MHz transmission, while the KR5V1X indicated 313.8 MHz. There were further subdivisions for "Driver 1" and "Driver 2" memory keys, each with unique part numbers.
* Architecture: The underlying logic was Hitag 3 (ID47). The security relied on a 96-bit secret key. While robust against casual attacks, it was theoretically vulnerable to brute-force attacks if an attacker could capture enough challenge-response pairs, though in practice, relay attacks were the primary threat vector.
* Programming: The programming procedure for KR5V2X keys was relatively forgiving. The BCM would accept a wide range of aftermarket keys as long as the chip ID was correct. Aftermarket diagnostic tools like the Autel IM508 or Xhorse Key Tool Max could easily emulate these keys using generic "Honda ID47" profiles.
3.2. The KR5TP-4 Family (11th Gen Modern)
The KR5TP-4 family is the exclusive standard for the "Honda Architecture" era.
* Vehicles: Its application list is strictly defined by the platform switch: Civic (2022-2025), HR-V (2023-2026), CR-V (2023-2026), Pilot (2023-2025), and Accord (2023+).
* FCC IDs: The ecosystem is far more consolidated. The KR5TP-4 covers the majority of the lineup, reducing the need for frequency checking. However, the Odyssey remains a notable exception, utilizing the KR5T4X ID (discussed in section 6.1).
* Architecture: The logic is Hitag AES (ID4A). The move to 128-bit AES encryption makes traditional "cloning" mathematically infeasible. The security model assumes that the secret key cannot be extracted from the chip, forcing all key duplication to be done via the OBDII "All Keys Lost" programming method, which registers a new ID with the BCM rather than copying an old one.
* Programming: The programming environment is strictly regulated. The BCM expects a specific pre-coded handshake. The use of incorrect chips (ID47) or even correctly typed chips that lack the proper manufacturer pre-coding results in immediate communication termination.
3.3. Key Differentiator: The "Safety Check" Failure
The most common symptom distinguishing these two generations in the field is the "Safety Check Failed" error message displayed on diagnostic tablets.10 This error is not a generic connection failure; it is a specific diagnostic trouble code (DTC) interpretation.
In a 10th generation vehicle (KR5V2X), when a diagnostic tool initiates the "Add Key" routine, it sends a command to the BCM to wake up the transponder coils. The BCM energizes the LF antenna, the key responds, and the BCM verifies the Hitag 3 signature. If the signature is valid, the BCM opens the programming window.
In an 11th generation vehicle (KR5TP-4), the diagnostic tool—if not updated—might still attempt to send the legacy Hitag 3 wakeup command. The BCM, operating on the Hitag AES protocol, ignores this command or, if it receives a malformed response from the key, actively rejects the session. The diagnostic tool interprets this rejection as a failure of the "Safety Check"—a prerequisite system scan that ensures the immobilizer is healthy before attempting programming. This error is the hallmark of protocol mismatch: an ID47 tool trying to talk to an ID4A car.
4. The 11th Gen Programming Crisis and the "Universal Key" Solution
A significant portion of the research material points to widespread difficulties in programming keys for the 11th Gen Honda vehicles, particularly in "All Keys Lost" (AKL) situations. The transition to KR5TP-4 has introduced a "brick risk" that was largely absent in previous generations.
4.1. The BCM "Brick" Risk
There is a documented risk of damaging the Body Control Module (BCM) when attempting to program keys to the 2022+ Civic using certain aftermarket tools.13 Honda Service Bulletin MC-10228193-0001 alludes to BCMs becoming unresponsive after failed programming attempts.
The mechanism of this "brick" state appears to be a security lockout mode. If the BCM detects a sequence of invalid authentication attempts—such as those generated by a tool trying to brute-force a pin code or sending incorrect cryptographic headers—it may enter a "Tamper Protection" mode. In this mode, the BCM refuses to accept any keys, including valid OEM fobs. The alarm system may remain armed, and the ignition push-button becomes unresponsive. The official dealer remedy for this state is the replacement of the BCM unit, a repair that can exceed $1,000 in parts and labor.
4.2. The "Universal Key" Bypass Solution
One of the most profound and counter-intuitive insights from the research 13 is the discovery that Xhorse Universal Remotes (specifically XM38 smart keys generated as ID4A) can often bypass the BCM lock that rejects OEM keys. This phenomenon has been validated by multiple independent locksmith reports.
Hypothesis of Mechanism:
Why would a cheap aftermarket emulator work when a $200 OEM key fails? The answer likely lies in the rigidity of the OEM key's pre-coding versus the flexibility of the emulator.
1. Pre-Coding Rigidity: The OEM keys (KR5TP-4) come from the factory pre-coded with a specific "Manufacturer Code" and "Configuration Word". They behave strictly according to the Honda specification. If the BCM is in a "confused" or heightened security state (e.g., after a failed programming attempt), it may require a specific re-initialization sequence or a specific "learning mode" flag in the key's response that the virgin OEM key does not provide by default.
2. Emulation Flexibility: The Xhorse XM38 universal key is a programmable emulator. When a technician generates the "Civic 2022" profile on the XM38, the software likely writes a specific configuration to the emulator that mimics a "Dealer Key" or a "Service Key" state.
3. Protocol Handshake: It is highly probable that the Xhorse engineers, having reverse-engineered the AES handshake, configured their emulator to respond to the BCM's challenge with a "default" or "permissive" response that the BCM firmware is hardcoded to accept during factory provisioning. This "backdoor" or "service mode" handshake bypasses the strict checks applied to standard key registration, allowing the BCM to unlock and register the new ID.
Evidence:
* Snippet 14 demonstrates a successful AKL programming on a 2022 Civic using an Autel IM608 Pro 2 paired with an Autel IKEY (Universal Key). The technician explicitly generates the universal key first, then performs the programming. The video confirms that the process works without needing to replace the BCM, even in AKL scenarios.
* Snippet 13 corroborates this, stating explicitly: "For some reason even though the BCM will no longer accept OEM or aftermarket keys, it will accept an Xhorse smart key."


  



4.3. Tool Compatibility and Ecosystem
The move to Hitag AES has necessitated a tooling upgrade cycle for the locksmith industry. The old tools that worked on the 10th Gen will simply not function here.
* Autel: The IM508/IM608 series requires the latest software updates to communicate with the 2022+ Civic BCM. The "Safety Check Failed" error 10 is often resolved by ensuring the device is connected to the internet for online calculation, although the provided transcript 14 suggests that the calculation can be performed locally if the universal key is generated correctly. The Autel IKEY is the brand's proprietary universal remote compatible with this system.
* Xhorse: The Key Tool Plus and Key Tool Max Pro support the XM38 smart key. The XM38 is the hardware revision necessary to support 128-bit AES emulation (ID4A/8A). The older "XS" series smart keys were primarily for Hitag 3/Pro and lack the processing power or memory architecture to support the AES protocol.15
* Proprietary Dealer Tools: Honda's i-HDS (Interactive Honda Diagnostic System) remains the gold standard but requires an active subscription and a generic J2534 pass-through device. It does not suffer from the "brick" risk as it follows the strictly validated OEM protocol. However, it cannot program aftermarket universal keys, leaving it powerless to perform the "bypass" trick described above if the BCM is already in a locked state.
5. Security Vulnerabilities: Rolling-PWN and the AES Paradox
A paradox of the 11th Gen platform is that while the cryptographic primitive has been upgraded to military-grade AES-128, the system implementation remains vulnerable to logic attacks. The security is only as strong as its weakest link, and in Honda's case, the weak link is not the encryption, but the validation logic.
5.1. The "Rolling-PWN" Vulnerability (CVE-2021-46145)
Research snippets 18 highlight the "Rolling-PWN" vulnerability affecting Honda vehicles from 2012 through 2022. The timeline of this vulnerability is critical: it was disclosed in late 2021 and early 2022, right as the 11th Gen Civic (KR5TP-4) was launching. This implies that the 11th Gen system was designed and finalized before this vulnerability was publicly understood or patched in the firmware.
The Mechanism:
1. Rolling Codes: To prevent replay attacks (where an attacker records a "lock" signal and plays it back later), modern keys send a counter value that increments with each press. The car accepts only codes that are "newer" than the last one it received.
2. The Flaw: The Honda BCM implementation accepts a "sliding window" of codes to account for accidental button presses while away from the car. However, researchers discovered that by sending a specific sequence of "older" or "future" codes, they could force the BCM to resynchronize the counter to an arbitrary value.
3. The Attack: An attacker can capture a valid code sequence, replay the resynchronization sequence to "rewind" the BCM's internal counter, and then successfully replay the captured code to unlock the car.
Relevance to KR5TP-4 (11th Gen):
Crucially, the "Rolling-PWN" vulnerability is a logic flaw in the counter validation, not a cryptographic flaw in the encryption. Even though the 11th Gen KR5TP-4 uses AES-128 to encrypt the payload, if the BCM's logic for accepting the decrypted counter is flawed, the encryption does not prevent the attack.
* The research indicates this vulnerability extends to models "up to 2022", implicating the early production units of the 11th Gen Civic.
* This suggests that Honda migrated the legacy rolling code validation logic (from the Hitag 3 system) to the new AES system without patching the underlying logic flaw initially.
* While later firmware updates (late 2023/2024) may address this, the hardware platform itself (KR5TP-4) remains associated with this vulnerability in its initial release versions.
6. Comprehensive Mapping of KR5TP-4 Applications
The KR5TP-4 FCC ID is not a monolith; it covers a specific range of "Honda Architecture" vehicles. However, exceptions exist, most notably the Odyssey, which creates a trap for the unwary technician.

	Note on the Odyssey Exception:
The Honda Odyssey (2021-2024) 7 utilizes a different FCC ID: KR5T4X.
* Chip: NCF2952 / Hitag 3 (ID47).
* Reason: The Odyssey sits on an older light-truck platform that has not yet migrated to the full "Honda Architecture" (HA) electrical bus used by the Civic/CR-V. Therefore, it retains the legacy ID47 system despite being a "2024" model. This is a critical distinction for locksmiths—do not use KR5TP-4 keys on an Odyssey. They are physically similar (both are 5-button smart keys) but electronically incompatible.
7. Deep Dive: The AES Encryption Advantage
Why did Honda switch to Hitag AES? The move is driven by industry-wide pressure to abandon proprietary "Security by Obscurity" algorithms.
7.1. Weakness of Proprietary Ciphers (Hitag 2/3)
Hitag 2 (48-bit) and Hitag 3 (96-bit) were proprietary algorithms developed by NXP (formerly Philips). Because they were not open to public scrutiny, vulnerabilities were eventually found by academic researchers (e.g., the "Gone in 360 Seconds" attack on Hitag 2). Once the algorithm is reverse-engineered, the security collapses. The auto industry learned that proprietary math is often bad math.
7.2. Strength of AES-128
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a globally standard, open algorithm. Its security relies entirely on the secrecy of the key, not the algorithm.
* Key Length: 128 bits offers $3.4 \times 10^{38}$ possible combinations.
* Brute Force: Impossible with current computing power.
* Implication: The only way to clone a KR5TP-4 key is to extract the 128-bit Secret Key (SK) from the vehicle's BCM or the original key. Since the NCF29A1M chip has hardware protections against key extraction (side-channel defenses), cloning is effectively dead for this generation.
* Result: "All Keys Lost" programming must now be done via the OBDII port (registering a new ID) rather than cloning an existing key's signal. This shifts the attack surface from the RF interface (cloning) to the OBDII interface (programming).
8. Market Analysis: The Chip Shortage Impact
The transition to KR5TP-4 occurred during the peak of the global semiconductor shortage (2021-2022). This context is vital for understanding the supply chain dynamics.
* Impact: The shortage likely accelerated the shift to newer, more available silicon (NCF29A1M) as older fab lines for NCF2952 were constrained. It is common for semiconductor manufacturers to prioritize the production of newer, higher-margin chips during a shortage, effectively forcing automakers to migrate to the new platforms faster than planned.
* Availability: Refurbished and aftermarket keys are critical. Snippet 23 shows refurbished OEM keys selling for ~$38, significantly cheaper than dealer prices which can exceed $150.
* Aftermarket Dominance: The Xhorse XM38 15 has become the de-facto solution for 11th Gen Honda keys because it can be generated to match the KR5TP-4 profile on-demand, mitigating stock issues. A locksmith no longer needs to stock the specific "Pilot" key; they can stock a generic XM38 and generate the "Civic 2022" software, which often works across the KR5TP-4 range due to the unified ID4A protocol.
9. Conclusion
The Honda 11th Generation smart key system, anchored by the KR5TP-4 FCC ID and the NCF29A1M (Hitag AES) transponder, represents a massive leap forward in cryptographic security but a stumbling block for field serviceability.
The move from Hitag 3 (ID47) to Hitag AES (ID4A) has rendered a decade of locksmithing knowledge and tools partially obsolete. The incompatibility is absolute: an ID47 key cannot speak to an ID4A BCM. Furthermore, the BCM's aggressive security logic has created a "minefield" where improper programming attempts can disable the vehicle control unit.
For the automotive security professional, the path forward involves:
1. Strict Identification: verifying FCC ID (KR5TP-4) and frequency (433.92 MHz) before any work.
2. Tooling Upgrade: Ensuring programmers (Autel/Xhorse) are updated to support "Honda ID4A" protocols.
3. Universal Key Adoption: Utilizing generated universal remotes (XM38) as the primary method for "All Keys Lost" recovery to bypass BCM rigidities.
While the "Rolling-PWN" vulnerability serves as a reminder that robust encryption (AES) cannot fix flawed logic (rolling codes), the KR5TP-4 platform is significantly more resistant to cloning and unauthorized duplication than its predecessors, marking a new era of "hardened" Honda security.

10. Appendix: Detailed Programming Procedure (Autel IM608/508)
Based on the validated procedure in 14:
1. Preparation: Close all doors. Ensure battery voltage > 12.5V. (Low voltage can cause BCM writes to fail, leading to corruption).
2. Generation: Generate Autel IKEY or Xhorse XM38 as "Honda Civic 2022 (ID4A)". Do not use a generic ID47 profile.
3. Connection: Connect IM608 to OBDII. Select "Honda > Manual Selection > Civic > 2022 > Smart Key".
4. Ignition Force: If ignition cannot turn ON, hold the "Start" button for repeated cycles or use the tool's "Force Ignition On" function (if supported) or hazard light method to wake the CAN bus.
5. Execution: Select "All Keys Lost". Follow the prompt to turn ignition OFF/ON.
6. Loop: The tool will ask to cycle ignition. Do so precisely.
7. Registration: The BCM will register the new key ID.
8. Verify: Test lock/unlock and proximity start.
This procedure bypasses the need for the Honda dealer server, performing the handshake calculation locally on the tool using the universal key's permissive emulator.

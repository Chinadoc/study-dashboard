Architectural Divergence in Automotive Access Control: An Exhaustive Analysis of Kia/Hyundai Post-Theft Security Protocols (2021–2025)
1. Executive Summary: The Bifurcation of Security Architectures
The automotive security landscape for Hyundai Motor Group (HMG)—encompassing both Hyundai and Kia brands—has undergone a radical and forced transformation between the model years 2021 and 2025. This evolution was not merely a linear progression of technology but a reactive restructuring precipitated by a catastrophic theft epidemic publicized via social media, widely known as the "Kia Boys" phenomenon. The crisis exposed a fundamental hardware omission in "turn-key" ignition vehicles, forcing the manufacturers to accelerate the deployment of defensive countermeasures that have fundamentally altered the serviceability, programming logic, and electronic architecture of their entire fleet, including the targeted Telluride, Sportage, and Santa Fe platforms.
This report provides a forensic-level analysis of these changes, dissecting the divergence between legacy systems and modern architectures. The analysis reveals a bifurcated security environment that separates vehicles not just by model year, but by specific production dates and trim levels. For legacy "turn-key" vehicles (2011–2022), the response was a retrospective software patch (Campaign 993/CS920) that modifies the Body Control Module (BCM) logic to emulate immobilization, a "virtual" solution to a physical problem. Conversely, for modern "Push-to-Start" (PTS) vehicles—specifically the 2023–2025 Telluride, Sportage, and Santa Fe—the evolution was hardware-driven. These vehicles have migrated from standard Controller Area Network (CAN) architectures to high-bandwidth CAN Flexible Data-Rate (CAN FD) systems protected by aggressive Security Gateway (SGW) modules.
Crucially, this report identifies a "silent lockout" affecting the automotive aftermarket. The transition to FCC ID TQ8-FOB-4F27, the implementation of 12+8 SGW firewalls, and the deliberate blocking of OBD-II PIN code extraction have created a complex matrix of compatibility that defies traditional programming methods. The mid-2023 production split serves as a critical demarcation line: vehicles assembled after this date require entirely new hardware protocols (CAN FD adapters) and strictly online cryptographic handshakes to authorize key programming. This shift has effectively monetized security access, moving the industry away from autonomous repair towards a centralized, server-dependent service model.
The following sections detail the forensic evidence of these changes, the specific technical specifications of the new hardware, and the procedural adaptations required for legitimate security professionals to navigate this new "digital fortress."
2. The Genesis of Vulnerability: The "Kia Boys" Epidemic and the Software Response
To understand the current state of programming and security, one must first deconstruct the vulnerability that necessitated these changes. The absence of hardware engine immobilizers in standard "turn-key" Hyundai and Kia models manufactured between 2011 and 2022 created a systemic vulnerability.1 While standard industry practice in most markets included transponder-based immobilizers that required a cryptographic handshake between the key and the ECU to enable the fuel or spark systems, HMG omitted this hardware in base trim levels for the US market. This omission allowed thieves to bypass the ignition cylinder and engage the starting mechanism using a simple USB cable as a torque tool to turn the ignition switch mechanism after stripping the steering column cover.
2.1 Campaign 993 and CS920: The "Virtual Immobilizer" Logic
In response to the theft epidemic and subsequent class-action lawsuits 2, Hyundai launched Service Campaign 993, and Kia launched the equivalent Service Campaign CS920.3 These updates were deployed to millions of vehicles, creating a schism in how the Body Control Module (BCM) processes ignition requests.
This update was not a mere "patch"; it was a fundamental rewrite of the vehicle's state machine logic. Prior to the update, the ignition circuit operated on a simple relay logic: if the ignition switch circuit was closed (turned to "Start"), the starter relay was energized, provided the transmission was in Park or Neutral. The key's physical presence was the only security token, but the lock cylinder itself was the weak point.
The Logic Shift:
Post-update, the BCM introduces a logical "AND" gate requirement for engine start. The software creates a "Virtual Immobilizer" state that tracks the vehicle's lock status.
* Condition A: Ignition switch is physically turned to the "Start" position.
* Condition B: The vehicle must be in a "Disarmed" state.
The critical change is how the "Disarmed" state is defined. The updated software dictates that the vehicle "Arms" (enters immobilization mode) approximately 30 seconds after the doors are locked via the remote key fob. Once armed, the BCM ignores any input from the ignition switch. The only recognized command to transition the system to "Disarmed" is a valid "Unlock" signal from the factory remote key fob.5
This logic creates a dependency on the Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) system that did not exist before. If a thief breaks the window—thereby bypassing the unlock command—and forces the ignition, the BCM maintains the "Armed" state. It sees the ignition request but, lacking the requisite "Disarmed" flag, it effectively "deadlines" the starter relay and fuel pump, preventing the engine from running.5 This solution mimics the behavior of a transponder immobilizer but relies entirely on the RKE signal rather than a short-range RFID chip in the key head.


  



2.2 Operational Side Effects and "Dead Fob" Lockouts
This logic shift introduced several operational paradoxes that confound owners and technicians. Because the "Disarm" command is strictly tied to the remote unlock signal, the physical door lock cylinder became a point of failure in the user experience.
If a user locks their vehicle with the fob (Arming the system) and subsequently the fob battery dies, using the physical key to open the door does not transmit the necessary RKE unlock packet. The BCM, seeing a door open without a remote command, assumes an intrusion event (an alarm state).5 In this state, inserting the key into the ignition will not start the car, because the software condition "Disarmed" has not been met. This effectively locks the owner out of starting their own vehicle, mimicking a theft attempt.
The workaround for this scenario varies by model and software version, but generally involves waiting for the alarm to time out or using specific "limp home" sequences that differ significantly from the pre-update behavior. Some reports suggest that turning the key to the "ON" position for a specific duration (e.g., 30 seconds) allows the BCM to eventually recognize the valid key cut code, but this is inconsistent and model-dependent.5
2.3 The "Silent Lockout": OBD-II Port Hardening
Perhaps the most significant consequence for the service industry is the hardening of the OBD-II port. The software update appears to have included patches to the BCM's diagnostic stack. Forensic analysis by automotive locksmiths indicates that vehicles updated with Campaign 993/CS920 frequently reject standard PIN code reading requests.7
Previously, aftermarket programming tools could query the BCM via the OBD-II port to extract the 6-digit PIN code required for key programming. The updated firmware closes the vulnerability that allowed this memory dump. The BCM now responds to these queries with "Access Denied" or security reject codes.9 This change forces locksmiths and independent repair shops to obtain the PIN code directly from the manufacturer's secure database (the Hyundai/Kia Tech Info portal), a process that requires vetting as a Vehicle Security Professional (VSP) via the National Automotive Service Task Force (NASTF). This effectively killed the "add-a-key" service for non-credentialed providers on these older models, monetizing the security access and centralizing control.
3. Hardware Architecture Analysis: The Evolution of the Smart Key
While the turn-key models received software patches, the Push-to-Start (PTS) models (Telluride, Sportage, Santa Fe) underwent significant hardware evolution. The user query highlights a specific confusion regarding FCC IDs: TQ8-FOB-4F24 versus TQ8-FOB-4F27. This change is not cosmetic; it represents a generational shift in the underlying vehicle network architecture.
3.1 Detailed Specification Analysis: 4F24 vs. 4F27
The research identifies two primary Smart Key generations active in the 2021–2025 window. Despite sharing the generic "HITAG3 / ID47" transponder designation, they serve different electronic architectures and are not interchangeable.
Generation 1: FCC ID TQ8-FOB-4F24
This key represents the "Legacy Modern" architecture.
* Primary Applications: Kia Telluride (2020–2022), Kia Niro (2019–2020).10
* Chipset: NCF29A1X (HITAG3 / ID47).
* Frequency: 433/434 MHz.
* Part Numbers: 95440-S9000 (Telluride).
* Architecture Association: Standard High-Speed CAN bus.
* Programming Characteristics: These vehicles generally allow for PIN code reading via OBD-II (unless updated with late-stage firmware) and utilize standard diagnostic protocols (ISO 15765-4). They do not typically require CAN FD adapters for programming.10 The BCM communicates at standard CAN speeds (500 kbps).
Generation 2: FCC ID TQ8-FOB-4F27
This key represents the "Next-Gen" architecture, specifically designed for high-bandwidth environments.
* Primary Applications: Hyundai Palisade (2023–2025), Hyundai Santa Fe (2021 Facelift – 2024 Redesign), Kia Sportage (Select 2023+ trims).13
* Chipset: NCF29A1X (HITAG3 / ID47).
* Frequency: 433/434 MHz.
* Part Numbers: 95440-S8550 (Palisade), 95440-S1670 (Santa Fe), 95440-K5012 (Santa Cruz).
* Architecture Association: High-Speed CAN FD (Flexible Data-Rate) and Secure Gateway (SGW).
* Critical Distinction: The FOB-4F27 is designed for the newer electrical platforms that support Digital Key 2.0 (Phone-as-a-Key) and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) features found on higher trim levels. Although the FCC filing lists it as a standard 433 MHz transmitter 16, its deployment coincides with the mandatory use of CAN FD protocols in the vehicle's BCM.17 The 4F27 key sends data packets that the older BCMs (associated with 4F24) cannot interpret correctly, and vice versa.
3.2 The Chipset Continuity Paradox
A confusing aspect for technicians is the persistence of the "HITAG3 ID47" chip type across both generations.10 A locksmith might assume that because the chip ID is identical, the programming method is the same. This assumption is dangerous. The difference lies not in the transponder chip itself, but in the Vehicle Interface (VI).
The 4F27 keys are paired with BCMs that communicate at flexible data rates (CAN FD). The payload of the data frames in these newer vehicles is larger (up to 64 bytes versus 8 bytes for standard CAN) to accommodate the more complex encryption keys used for Digital Key 2.0 verification. Older diagnostic tools, which communicate via standard high-speed CAN, are physically incapable of performing the "handshake" required to register the key, even if the key itself is technically compatible with the chip reader.17


  



4. Network Topology and Access Control: SGW and CAN FD
The security evolution extended beyond the keys themselves into the very nervous system of the vehicles. Around 2018, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) introduced the Security Gateway (SGW) to block unauthorized communications via the OBD-II port. By 2022/2023, Hyundai and Kia aggressively adopted similar architectures for their North American fleets, particularly in the Sportage, Telluride, and Santa Fe models.20
4.1 The Mechanism of Exclusion: The Security Gateway (SGW)
The SGW module acts as a digital firewall between the external OBD-II connector (the "public" network) and the internal vehicle networks (the "private" CAN bus).
* Allowed Traffic: Generic OBD-II emission read requests (legislated by US law).
* Blocked Traffic: Bi-directional controls, Actuator tests, DTC clearing, and, most importantly, Immobilizer/Key Programming.20
When an unauthorized tool attempts to write data (e.g., sending an "Add Key" command), the SGW intercepts the message and returns a Negative Response Code (NRC) 0x33, signifying "Security Access Denied".20 This prevents the tool from ever reaching the BCM or ECU.
4.2 Bypassing the Wall: Methods and Controversy
Method 1: AutoAuth (Digital Bypass)
Authorized diagnostic tools (Snap-on, Autel, Bosch) can register with AutoAuth, a third-party authentication service that acts as a certificate authority.23 When the tool connects to the car, it sends a challenge to the AutoAuth server, which verifies the user's subscription and sends back a digital signature to unlock the SGW.
* Limitation: While AutoAuth successfully unlocks diagnostics (clearing codes, active tests), it does not universally grant authority for key programming or PIN retrieval on Hyundai/Kia vehicles. Many locksmiths report that even with active AutoAuth subscriptions, the "Add Key" function fails because the PIN reading algorithm is blocked by the separate BCM firmware update, or the Immobilizer partition requires a higher level of security clearance than AutoAuth provides.25
Method 2: Physical Bypass (Hardware Hack)
Because of the limitations of the digital bypass for key programming, technicians often resort to physical bypasses.
* The Technique: Technicians must physically locate the SGW module (often integrated into the Integrated Central Control Unit or "Smart Junction Block") and unplug the connectors to insert a "12+8" or similar bypass cable.20 This cable physically routes the diagnostic tool's pins directly to the vehicle's CAN bus, circumventing the gateway module entirely.
* Location Challenges - 2023 Sportage: The SGW is deeply embedded in the 2023 Sportage. Reports locate access points near the knee bolster or behind the instrument cluster, often requiring significant dashboard disassembly to access the "Green" CAN distribution block where the bypass can be inserted.20
* Location Challenges - Telluride: In the Telluride, the SGW is often integrated into the Smart Junction Block (SJB), making a simple plug-unplug bypass difficult without specific adapter cables that intercept the CAN lines before they hit the gateway.
4.3 The CAN FD Paradigm Shift (2023–2025)
The most significant technical hurdle identified in the research is the migration to Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate (CAN FD). This is not just a security update; it is an infrastructure overhaul.
The Mid-2023 Production Split
Research indicates a hard production date split affecting the 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe and 2024 Kia Telluride, as well as late-production 2023 models.
* Split Date: Vehicles manufactured after June 2023 (often labeled as MY2024) predominantly utilize the CAN FD protocol for the Body Control Module.18
* Implication: A standard locksmith programmer (e.g., Xtool, Autel IM608 Pro) using a standard OBD-II cable cannot communicate with the vehicle. The tool will simply fail to connect or report "Communication Error" because it is broadcasting at 500 kbps (standard CAN) while the vehicle is listening for 2-5 Mbps (CAN FD) bursts.17
The "CAN FD Adapter" Requirement
To program keys for these post-split vehicles, a specialized CAN FD Adapter is mandatory. This hardware dongle plugs between the diagnostic tablet and the vehicle's OBD port. It translates the high-speed signals for the older tool hardware.17
* Affected Models:
   * 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe.17
   * 2024 Kia Telluride.31
   * 2023+ Kia Sportage (Select trims).19
Without this adapter, even a legitimate dealer PIN code is useless because the tool cannot establish the initial session with the BCM. This requirement catches many technicians off guard, as the vehicle looks identical to the previous year's model but contains an entirely different language on its internal network.
4.4 Chronology of Security Architecture Evolution
To visualize the progression of these technologies, we can map the changes chronologically:
* 2021 Model Year:
   * Architecture: Standard CAN Bus.
   * Security: Pre-SGW (or passive SGW).
   * Key Type: FCC ID TQ8-FOB-4F24 (Telluride).
   * Status: Vulnerable to "Kia Boys" theft (Turn-key). Open to OBD PIN reading (PTS).
* 2022 Model Year:
   * Architecture: Standard CAN Bus.
   * Security: Transitional. Some models begin receiving SGW.
   * Update: Software Campaign 993/CS920 begins rollout, hardening BCMs and blocking OBD PIN reading on updated units.
* 2023 Model Year (Early Production):
   * Architecture: SGW becomes standard on Sportage/Telluride.
   * Key Type: Introduction of TQ8-FOB-4F27 (Sportage/Palisade).
   * Status: "AutoAuth" or Physical Bypass required for diagnostics.
* 2023 Model Year (Late Production - Post June 2023) / 2024 Model Year:
   * Architecture: CAN FD implementation becomes widespread.
   * Security: SGW + CAN FD.
   * Status: "Fortress Mode." Requires CAN FD Adapter, Physical/Digital Bypass, and Dealer PIN. OBD PIN reading is impossible.
5. Forensic Analysis of the Programming "Lockout"
Perhaps the most significant non-hardware change is the hardening of PIN code access, which has effectively locked out the casual aftermarket.
5.1 The Death of OBD PIN Reading
Historically, automotive locksmith tools could read the 6-digit PIN code from the BCM's EEPROM via the OBD port. The tool would exploit a vulnerability in the UDS protocol to dump the memory sector containing the PIN. The 2023 security updates and the 2024 architecture shift have closed this backdoor.
* Encryption: The data storage for the PIN is now encrypted or stored in a "Secure World" partition of the processor (often a Renesas or Infineon TriCore chip) that does not respond to standard read commands.7
* Server-Side Verification: Newer PINs are rolling or time-dependent. While not fully confirmed as "rolling codes" in the classic sense (changing every minute), the static PINs are no longer accessible via local extraction.
* Impact: Locksmiths must now pay for "PIN Code Services" (often $20-$60 per code) or be a registered Vehicle Security Professional (VSP) with access to the Hyundai/Kia tech info site.32 The update has effectively monetized the security access.
5.2 Tool Compatibility Matrix
The landscape of compatible tools has shifted dramatically.
* Autel IM508/IM608: Requires CAN FD Adapter for 2024 models. Requires AutoAuth subscription for 2023+. PIN reading fails on updated firmware.9
* Xtool (AutoProPad): Requires M811 CAN FD Adapter. Known to struggle with SGW authentication without physical bypass.17
* Smart Pro: Requires active subscription and internet connection. Often requires the user to purchase the PIN code separately before beginning the session.34


  



6. Procedural Protocols and Emergency Contingencies
The divergence in hardware necessitates two distinct programming procedures. The "All Keys Lost" (AKL) scenario is particularly sensitive to these changes.
6.1 Post-Update / CAN FD Procedure (2024+ Models)
This procedure applies to the 2024 Telluride, 2024 Santa Fe, and late-production 2023 Sportage.
* Tooling: Professional Programmer + CAN FD Adapter + Valid PIN Code (Purchased).
* Step 1: Connection: Connect the CAN FD Adapter to the OBD port, then connect the programmer to the adapter. Direct connection will result in communication failure.31
* Step 2: Authentication: If AutoAuth is supported and active, log in. If not, perform a physical bypass of the SGW if the tool cannot negotiate the firewall.
* Step 3: PIN Entry: Navigate to "Control Unit" -> "Body" -> "Teaching". The "Read PIN" function will fail. Manually input the 6-digit PIN obtained from the dealer/broker.
* Step 4: The "Fob Teaching" Window: On 2024 models, once the PIN is accepted, the "Key Learn" window is extremely short (often 5 seconds). The technician must immediately hold the top of the smart key against the Start/Stop button.31
* Step 5: Verification: The hazard lights will flash to confirm programming. Repeat immediately for a second key.
6.2 The "Dead Fob" Emergency Start Logic
A common panic point for owners of these new vehicles is the "Key Not Detected" error when the fob battery dies. The procedure has evolved from the physical slots found in 2011-2015 models.
* Entry: Use the mechanical key blade (hidden in the fob) to open the driver's door. The keyhole is often covered by a cosmetic cap that must be popped off.36
* Start: Press the Start/Stop button directly with the Smart Key itself. The button housing contains a Low Frequency (LF) inductive antenna ring. When the key is pressed against it (usually at a 90-degree angle), the ring energizes the passive transponder chip in the fob (ID47), allowing the car to authenticate the key even without any battery power in the remote.35
* Logic Conflict: Post-software update (Campaign 993), if the alarm was triggered by the key entry, this procedure may be temporarily disabled or require a "soak" period (waiting 5-10 minutes) for the BCM to reset its alarm state before it will accept the transponder signal.5
7. Model-Specific Security Case Studies
To contextualize these changes, we examine the three target platforms.
Case Study A: 2022 Kia Telluride (Legacy)
* System: Standard CAN.
* Key: TQ8-FOB-4F24.
* Status: Generally programmable with standard tools. PIN reading might work depending on software version. Vulnerable to "Kia Boys" theft only if it is a lower trim (LX) with a turn-key ignition; PTS models are secure but use older architecture.
Case Study B: 2023 Kia Sportage (Transitional)
* System: SGW Enabled.
* Key: TQ8-FOB-4F27.
* Status: The "Problem Child." The SGW is difficult to access physically. Early 2023 models might be standard CAN, while late 2023 models (June+) shift to CAN FD logic. This requires technicians to test communication protocols; if standard CAN fails, the CAN FD adapter is needed.19
Case Study C: 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe (Modern)
* System: Native CAN FD + SGW.
* Key: TQ8-FOB-4F27 (or updated part number 95440-S1670).
* Status: Fully hardened. Requires CAN FD adapter and dealer PIN. No OBD PIN reading possible. Supports Digital Key 2.0 (UWB) features, explaining the need for the high-bandwidth CAN FD network.17
8. Conclusion and Future Outlook
The security landscape for the Kia Telluride, Sportage, and Hyundai Santa Fe (2021–2025) is defined by disjointed modernization. The "Kia Boys" incident forced Hyundai and Kia to leapfrog a decade of security evolution in 24 months.
1. Software: The anti-theft update (Campaign 993) patched the ignition vulnerability on older cars but blocked OBD PIN reading, complicating service and serviceability.
2. Hardware: The 2024 model year (production post-June 2023) marks a hard transition to CAN FD, rendering older diagnostic tools obsolete without adapters.
3. Procedure: Successful programming now requires a CAN FD Adapter, a Purchased PIN, and often a Physical SGW Bypass.
The era of "plug-and-play" key programming for these brands is over. The industry is moving toward a model where access is gated by proprietary hardware (CAN FD), server-side authentication (AutoAuth/NASTF), and encrypted credentials (Dealer PINs). For the 2025 model year and beyond, we can expect this trend to solidify with the wider adoption of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for Digital Key 2.0, likely pushing the "Smart Key" into a purely digital credential managed via smartphone, with the physical fob becoming a secondary, albeit highly sophisticated, accessory.

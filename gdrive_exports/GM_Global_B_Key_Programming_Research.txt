The Fortress of Intelligence: A Comprehensive Technical Analysis of GM Global B (VIP) Architecture, 2019–2025
1. Executive Summary: The Paradigm Shift in Automotive Security
The automotive industry is currently navigating its most profound electronic infrastructure transformation in two decades, a shift that fundamentally alters the relationship between the vehicle, the dealership, and the independent aftermarket. For General Motors (GM), this evolution is encapsulated in the transition from the legacy "Global A" architecture to the Global B architecture, formally designated as the Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP). This report serves as an exhaustive technical analysis of the Global B architecture, specifically tailored for security professionals, automotive locksmiths, and diagnostic specialists who are currently confronting the formidable "All Keys Lost" (AKL) blockade on flagship models such as the Chevrolet Silverado, Corvette C8, and Cadillac CT5.
The Global B architecture is not merely an incremental update; it represents a complete reimagining of the vehicle’s nervous system. Where Global A relied on a standard Controller Area Network (CAN) bus structure that had become the industry standard since the mid-2000s, Global B introduces a high-speed ethernet backbone, the encrypted CAN FD (Flexible Data-Rate) protocol, and a centralized cybersecurity gateway that rigorously enforces authentication for all critical module interactions.1 The primary engineering objectives behind this shift are to facilitate robust Over-the-Air (OTA) software updates, support the massive data throughput required for active safety systems like Super Cruise, and fortify the vehicle against remote cyber intrusions.1
However, a significant collateral consequence of this hardening has been the systemic exclusion of traditional aftermarket key programming methodologies. The "Gap" identified in the current market is substantial: the inability of standard diagnostic tools to communicate with, let alone program, the Body Control Module (BCM) or Engine Control Module (ECM) without passing a rigorous, server-side security handshake. This report delineates the technical boundaries of this system, provides a definitive master list of architecture status by model and VIN, and evaluates the efficacy and risks of emerging aftermarket solutions that attempt to emulate the OEM security token.


  



2. Technical Anatomy of the Global B (VIP) Platform
To comprehend the sheer difficulty of key programming on Global B platforms, one must first deconstruct the transport layer changes that render legacy tools obsolete. The automotive aftermarket spent over a decade refining tools for Global A, which relied heavily on GMLAN (General Motors Local Area Network), a proprietary implementation of standard CAN. Global B eliminates Low-Speed GMLAN entirely, replacing it with a hybrid network of CAN FD and Automotive Ethernet that fundamentally changes how modules "speak" to one another.2
2.1. The CAN FD Protocol and Physical Layer Barriers
The most immediate hurdle for any technician interfacing with a 2021+ GM vehicle is the adoption of CAN FD (Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate). Standard CAN, the backbone of Global A, typically transmits data at a speed of 500 kbps with a maximum payload of 8 bytes per frame. This limitation was sufficient for transmitting simple signals like door lock status or engine RPM but is woefully inadequate for the gigabytes of data generated by modern radar, lidar, and high-definition infotainment systems.
CAN FD shatters these limits, increasing the data transfer rate to up to 5 Mbps in practice and expanding the payload capacity to 64 bytes per frame.2 This increase in bandwidth and speed creates a physical layer barrier for older equipment. Legacy locksmith tools, such as older T-Code Pros, MVP Pros, or first-generation cloning devices, lack the hardware transceivers capable of interpreting these higher frequencies and larger packet sizes. When plugged into the OBDII port of a Global B vehicle, these tools effectively hear nothing—static noise—because they cannot synchronize with the bus speed. This necessitates the use of active CAN FD adapters (such as those from Autel or OBDSTAR) that act as interpreters, downscaling or buffering the signal so the diagnostic tablet can process it.3
2.2. The Logic Layer Barrier: The Encrypted Security Token
Resolving the physical connection via a CAN FD adapter is only the first step. The far more formidable barrier is the Logic Layer, specifically the security authentication protocol required to authorize "write" commands to the BCM. In the Global A era, security access was managed through a relatively static challenge-response mechanism. A diagnostic tool would read a "seed" (a short hexadecimal string) from the vehicle, calculate a corresponding "key" using a known algorithm, and send it back to unlock the module.
In the Global B architecture, this system has been replaced by a dynamic, server-dependent authentication process involving a 24-digit security code.5 The mechanism functions as follows:
1. Request: The diagnostic tool initiates a request for security access to the BCM or Radio Frequency Hub Module (RFHM) to perform a sensitive function, such as "Add Key" or "All Keys Lost."
2. Challenge: The vehicle's Gateway Module generates a massive, encrypted seed. This seed is unique to that specific session and is derived from the vehicle's VIN and the specific module's serialization data.
3. Authentication (The "Phone Home"): Unlike Global A, where the "key" could be calculated locally by the tool's firmware, the Global B seed must be transmitted to a central authority. In the OEM workflow, this is GM's back-end server via Techline Connect. The server validates the VIN's status (checking for theft reports or blocks), calculates the correct 24-digit response token using proprietary, rotating encryption keys, and sends it back to the tool.
4. Authorization: The tool relays this 24-digit token to the vehicle. The BCM verifies the token against its own internal calculation. If they match, the secure gateway opens the programming window.7
This architecture enforces a strict "online-only" philosophy. Without a verified connection to a server capable of performing this calculation—whether it be GM's official server or a third-party server that has reverse-engineered the algorithm—the vehicle remains locked. This effectively eliminates the possibility of truly offline key programming for Global B vehicles, a major departure from previous generations.
3. The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra "Split": A Forensic Analysis
Perhaps the most contentious and confusing aspect of the Global B rollout is the 2022 model year for the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500. Driven by supply chain constraints, semiconductor shortages, and production timing, GM simultaneously manufactured two distinct versions of the same truck under the "2022" model year designation. These vehicles, while sharing a nameplate, are alien to one another in terms of electronic architecture.
3.1. Defining the Variants: Limited vs. Refresh
The industry distinguishes these two variants as the 2022 Limited (Pre-Refresh) and the 2022 Refresh (often noted as 2022.5).
* 2022 Limited (Pre-Refresh): This vehicle is effectively a continuation of the 2021 model year. It utilizes the older body style, the legacy interior, and crucially, the Global A electronic architecture (or a transitional hybrid that is still accessible via standard OBDII programming). Locksmiths can program keys for this variant using standard procedures without the need for complex CAN FD adapters or server-side tokens.
* 2022 Refresh (2022.5): This represents the true next-generation truck. It features a redesigned front fascia, a completely overhauled interior with a digital dashboard, and the Global B (VIP) architecture. Key programming for this variant is strictly gated behind the CAN FD protocol and the 24-digit security token requirement.10
3.2. The 12th Digit Rule: The Definitive Identifier
While the user query asks for identification by the "10th/11th VIN digit," a precise technical analysis reveals that for the specific case of the 2022 Silverado/Sierra split, the 12th digit is the critical discriminator.
* 10th Digit (Year): Both the Limited and the Refresh models will typically display 'N' (2022) in the 10th position, rendering this digit insufficient for distinguishing between the two architectures.
* 11th Digit (Plant Code): The 11th digit indicates the manufacturing plant (e.g., 'G' for Silao, Mexico; 'Z' for Fort Wayne, Indiana). While certain plants may have switched to the new platform earlier, relying on the plant code is imprecise as some plants produced both body styles during the transition period.
* 12th Digit (Sequence Number): Research confirms that the 12th digit of the VIN is the most reliable indicator for the platform split.
   * Pre-Refresh 2022 Models (Global A): The 12th digit is 4 or lower (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
   * Refreshed 2022.5 Models (Global B): The 12th digit is 5 or higher (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).10
Technicians must prioritize this "12th Digit Rule" above all else. Visual cues, while helpful, can be deceptive. For example, a "Work Truck" (WT) trim of the Refresh model may still have a column shifter and a simpler dashboard that resembles the older Limited model, yet underneath the plastic, it possesses the locked Global B BCM. Attempting to program a Global B "Refresh" truck using "Limited" protocols can lead to communication errors or, in worst-case scenarios, module corruption (bricking) as the tool forces legacy commands over the high-speed Ethernet lines.11
3.3. Secondary Indicators: RPO Codes and Physical Features
Beyond the VIN, technicians can verify the architecture through Regular Production Option (RPO) codes found on the QR code label (typically on the B-pillar). The presence of the J22 RPO code is a definitive marker for the Refresh (Global B) engineering change.11
* Interior Cues: The Refresh models (Global B) generally feature a full digital gauge cluster and a center console-mounted electronic gear selector on higher trims (LT, RST, High Country). The Limited models (Global A) retain the analog gauges and the steering column-mounted shift lever.10
* Engine Cues: For diesel models, the engine code can also serve as a hint. The 2022 Limited typically pairs with the LM2 Duramax engine, while the 2022 Refresh (and all 2023+ models) utilizes the updated LZ0 Duramax engine.10


  



4. Master List: Global A vs. Global B by Model and Year
The transition to Global B has not been a simultaneous fleet-wide update. Instead, it has been a staggered rollout, beginning with low-volume, high-technology platforms and cascading down to high-volume trucks and SUVs. This staggered implementation creates a complex landscape where a 2023 model of one vehicle may be fully locked down, while a 2023 model of another remains completely accessible. The following master list categorizes vehicles based on their architecture status, derived from cross-referencing diagnostic tool support lists and GM service bulletins.2
4.1. The "Hard" Global B Vehicles (Dealer/Server Required)
These vehicles utilize the full VIP architecture. In "All Keys Lost" situations, the only viable paths are the official dealership method (SPS2) or specific aftermarket tools (like Autel or OBDSTAR) that possess active server subscriptions and CAN FD adapters.

	4.3. The "Hybrid" / Edge Cases
Certain vehicles occupy a transitional space where they utilize newer communication protocols (CAN FD) but may not enforce the full severity of the Global B security blockade, or present unique programming behaviors.
* Chevrolet Bolt EV / EUV (2022-2023): This vehicle is an anomaly. While it technically requires a CAN FD adapter for communication (indicating a move toward newer protocols), reports from the field suggest that key programming logic is often a hybrid. "Add Key" functions can sometimes be performed with less friction than on a Corvette or Silverado, but "All Keys Lost" scenarios can still be problematic and tool-dependent.34
4.4. The Chronological Rollout of Global B
The data reveals a clear, phased implementation strategy by GM, which can be visualized as a timeline of increasing restriction:
* 2020: The Corvette C8 and Cadillac CT4/CT5 launch as the vanguard of the new architecture. Locksmiths immediately encounter the "brick wall" of the new encrypted ECMs.
* 2021: The high-margin, full-size SUVs (Tahoe, Suburban, Yukon, Escalade) migrate to Global B. This is the first high-volume application, signaling the end of easy programming for GM's most popular family haulers.
* 2022: The Silverado/Sierra 1500 undergoes its mid-cycle refresh (2022.5), bringing Global B to the highest-volume vehicle in GM's portfolio. The "Limited" models provide a temporary reprieve for the year.
* 2023: The mid-size trucks (Colorado/Canyon) join the Global B family with their redesigns.
* 2024: The Heavy Duty (HD) trucks and the entry-level Trax and Acadia complete the transition. By this point, the majority of GM's retail showroom is effectively locked to traditional tools.
5. The "All Keys Lost" Scenario: Anatomy of a Lockout
The "All Keys Lost" (AKL) scenario on a Global B vehicle is the definitive stress test for any security solution. In previous generations, an AKL situation was resolved by "brute forcing" a delay (typically 12 minutes) or bypassing the BCM's security wait time to erase existing keys and program new ones.
On Global B vehicles, this workflow is impossible offline. The BCM does not contain a static PIN that can be read or bypassed. Instead, it enters a "Challenge" state. When a tool requests to add a key or erase keys, the BCM generates a unique, session-specific seed. This seed is useless without the corresponding 24-digit key, which can only be generated by GM's central security server.
* The Timeout Constraint: The system imposes a strict timeout. Once the seed is generated, the tool has a limited window (often seconds or minutes depending on the specific module firmware) to provide the correct response. If the internet connection lags, or the server calculation is too slow, the session expires, and the process must restart with a new seed.
* The "Active Alarm" Problem: In AKL scenarios, the vehicle's alarm is often active. On Global B vehicles, an active alarm can sometimes lock down communication ports, preventing even the initial handshake. This often requires physically silencing the alarm or waiting for a specific timeout period before the OBDII port becomes responsive.
6. The Security Token and Aftermarket Tool Ecosystem
The aftermarket industry has engaged in an arms race to develop solutions for the 24-digit Security Token. While no tool has "cracked" the encryption in the sense of a permanent offline bypass, several manufacturers have developed methods to emulate the OEM server handshake. These solutions invariably require an active internet connection, as the heavy lifting of token calculation is offloaded to the tool manufacturer's cloud servers.
6.1. The Official Route: SPS2 (Service Programming System)
The only officially sanctioned and guaranteed method for programming keys on a Global B vehicle is to utilize the OEM toolchain. This path is rigorous and costly but offers the highest reliability.
* Hardware Interface: A GM MDI2 (Multiple Diagnostic Interface 2) is the standard. High-quality J2534 passthrough devices (e.g., DrewTech Cardaq Plus 3) are also supported for programming, though connection stability is paramount.
* Software Platform: Techline Connect (the successor to TIS2WEB), utilizing the SPS2 application. This software resides on a Windows PC and acts as the bridge between the car and GM's servers.
* Credentialing: The user must possess a valid GM Dealer login or a NASTF (National Automotive Service Task Force) VSP (Vehicle Security Professional) credential. The VSP ID is required to access the security-related functions of the Immobilizer system.
* The Workflow: The MDI2 connects to the vehicle's OBDII port. The laptop, connected via Wi-Fi or Ethernet to the MDI2 and the internet, logs into Techline Connect. The software reads the VIN, verifies the user's VSP credentials, and automatically handles the 24-digit token exchange in the background. The user simply follows the on-screen prompts to "Add Key" or "Program IMMO.".20
6.2. Aftermarket Solutions: The "Server-Side" Bypass
Aftermarket tool manufacturers have developed "proxy" solutions. In these workflows, the handheld tool acts as the interface, reading the seed from the car and transmitting it to the manufacturer's server (e.g., Autel's server). This server, likely possessing a mirrored version of the GM algorithm or a bridge to authorized credentials, calculates the PIN and sends it back to the tool.
Autel (MaxiIM IM608 Pro / IM508S / IM608 Pro II)
Autel is currently the market leader for Global B support in the independent channel, but the capability is strictly defined by hardware and subscription status.
* Hardware Requirement: The Autel CAN FD Adapter is mandatory. Without this adapter connected between the VCI and the OBDII port, the tool cannot communicate with the vehicle's CAN FD bus.4 Newer VCIs (like the V200 included with the KM100 or the VCI with IM608 Pro II) may have internal CAN FD support, but the external adapter is often still recommended for stability on the IM608 Pro.
* Server Dependency: The user must select the "CANFD Smart Key" menu. Upon initiating the key learning process, the tool will prompt for an internet connection. It reads the BCM data and sends the request to Autel's cloud. The calculation process typically takes 5–10 minutes.
* Coverage: Autel supports the Corvette C8, Silverado (2021+ Global B), Tahoe/Suburban (2021+), and Cadillac CT4/CT5. Crucially, Autel recently reinstated the 24-digit calculation function after a temporary suspension, highlighting the volatility of this "gray market" access.9
* Limitations: The process is entirely dependent on Autel's server uptime. If the server is undergoing maintenance or if GM blocks the specific access route Autel is using, the tool will fail to retrieve the token.39
OBDSTAR (KeyMaster DP Plus / G3)
OBDSTAR has emerged as a nimble competitor, often releasing updates for specific models faster than larger competitors.
* Hardware Requirement: Like Autel, a CAN FD Adapter is required. Additionally, for certain "All Keys Lost" situations on specific models (like 2021+ Equinox or specific proximity systems), OBDSTAR may require proprietary cables (e.g., the CAN Direct kit or Toyota-30 style cables adapted for GM) to connect directly to the BCM or gateway if OBDII access is blocked by an alarm state.40
* Internet & Credits: The tool requires a stable Wi-Fi connection. While basic key programming is often included in the update subscription, advanced calculations or frequent use may tap into a "credits" system depending on the specific distributor and region.42
* Recent Updates: OBDSTAR's software version GM V33.xx+ added significant support for proximity key programming on 2022+ models, including the Yukon and Sierra.43
AutoProPad (XTool)
* Capabilities: The AutoProPad G2 Turbo is CAN FD compatible and lists support for 2021+ GM vehicles. It functions similarly to the others, utilizing an internet connection to pull PIN codes.
* Performance: Field reports suggest that while AutoProPad is highly effective for Global A and transitional models, its success rate on the newest, fully patched Global B "All Keys Lost" scenarios (especially 2023-2024 models) can be less consistent than Autel or the OEM method. It allows for reading pin codes and adding keys via OBDII for supported CAN FD models, but users should verify specific model year support on the manufacturer's application list before committing to a job.3


  



7. Deep Dive: Model-Specific Challenges and Nuances
7.1. The Corvette C8: The Unbreakable Fortress
The Chevrolet Corvette C8 serves as the flagship for the Global B architecture and represents the most hardened target in the lineup. Its Engine Control Module (ECM), the E99, employs a security architecture so rigorous that for several years, aftermarket tuners (such as HP Tuners) could not flash the vehicle via OBDII at all. To this day, tuning a C8 often requires physically removing the ECM and shipping it to a specialist for a one-time "unlock" service that modifies the bootloader.18
In terms of key programming, the C8 is unforgiving. "All Keys Lost" programming via aftermarket tools is fraught with risk. The preferred method remains the dealer SPS2 process. While tools like Autel list support, the success rate is lower than on the trucks, and the procedure often involves longer server calculation times. If the process fails midway, the vehicle's rigorous anti-theft protocols can leave it in a "bricks" state that requires a tow to the dealership.21
7.2. The 2024 HD Truck Surprise
A major pain point for locksmiths in the current year has been the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 2500/3500 HD. For the 2020–2023 model years, the HD trucks did not follow the 1500 series into the Global B transition. A locksmith could program a 2023 Silverado 3500 High Country using a standard, non-CAN FD tool in minutes.
However, with the 2024 refresh (identifiable by the new C-shaped LED daytime running lights and the updated interior), the HD lineup has fully migrated to Global B. This caught many technicians off guard, leading to failed jobs where tools that worked perfectly on a "brand new" 2023 model suddenly failed to communicate with a 2024 model sitting right next to it on the lot. The diagnosis is simple: if the 2024 HD has the new digital dashboard, it is a Global B vehicle requiring the 24-digit token.25
7.3. The Bolt EUV Hybrid Logic
The Chevrolet Bolt EUV (2022-2023) presents an interesting edge case. While it utilizes the newer CAN FD protocol for communication—necessitating the adapter for tools like the Autel IM608—its security logic appears to be a hybrid. Reports indicate that "Add Key" functions can often be performed with less friction than on the fully locked VIP platforms like the CT5. However, "All Keys Lost" still presents significant hurdles. The key takeaway for the Bolt is that while the hardware (CAN FD) is required, the software barriers are slightly more permeable than the internal-combustion flagships, potentially due to the unique architecture of its electric powertrain controllers.34
7.4. The Gray Market: PIN Code Brokers
A "gray market" service industry has emerged to fill the gap for technicians who lack expensive tools but possess basic CAN FD readers. These "PIN Code Calculation Services" operate on platforms like AliExpress or specialized forums.
* The Mechanism: The technician connects their tool, which displays the 62-digit challenge seed. They photograph this screen and send it to the broker. The broker, utilizing a cracked algorithm or a compromised OEM account, generates the 24-digit PIN and sends it back.
* The Risk: This workflow is inherently unstable. The seed is often time-sensitive. If the broker takes 20 minutes to reply, the seed may have expired, requiring a restart. Furthermore, relying on illicit access to GM's security servers is not a sustainable business model; GM actively patches these vulnerabilities, leading to sudden service blackouts for these third-party brokers.6
8. Troubleshooting and Error Recovery
Working on Global B vehicles carries a higher risk of "bricking" modules compared to Global A.
* "Service Theft Deterrent System" Message: This common error appears if the key programming process is interrupted or if an invalid token is presented. In many cases, this is a "soft brick" that can be resolved by disconnecting the battery (hard reset) and restarting the process with a stable internet connection.
* Communication Failures: If the tool fails to connect, the first check should always be the CAN FD Adapter. Ensure it is firmly seated. Secondly, check the Alarm State. If the alarm is sounding, the Gateway may be blocking the OBDII port. The alarm must be silenced (often by waiting out the cycle or using a mechanical key in the door if available) before communication can occur.
* Radio/HVAC Lockout: In some failed programming attempts, the BCM may desynchronize from the other modules, leading to a "Locked" radio or climate control system. This typically requires a "Module Setup" or "Configuration" procedure using the OEM SPS2 software to resynchronize the VIN across all modules.
9. Conclusion: The Future of the "Gap"
The analysis of the GM Global B architecture leads to a singular, undeniable conclusion: the era of offline, low-barrier automotive locksmithing is effectively over for General Motors vehicles produced after 2022. The "Gap" identified in the research query is not a temporary glitch; it is a permanent structural feature of the new automotive landscape.
The transition to the Vehicle Intelligence Platform has bifurcated the market. On one side are the legacy vehicles (Global A), which remain accessible to a wide range of independent service providers. On the other side is the growing fleet of Global B vehicles, which are effectively "walled gardens" accessible only to those with the capital to invest in advanced, server-connected diagnostic tools (like the Autel IM608 with CAN FD) or the official OEM credentialing (NASTF VSP and Techline Connect).
For the locksmith or technician, the path forward requires a three-pronged strategy:
1. Hardware Modernization: Immediate investment in CAN FD-capable hardware is non-negotiable.
2. Credentialing: Serious professionals must move toward obtaining official NASTF VSP credentials to bypass the reliance on potentially unstable "gray market" server calculations.
3. Education: Mastering the nuances of identification—such as the 12th Digit Rule for Silverados—is critical to avoiding costly liabilities.
As GM continues to roll out Global B to the remaining holdouts (Equinox, Express Van) and introduces even tighter security in future EV platforms, the "Gap" will only widen, serving as a filter that separates the modernized professional from the legacy operator.

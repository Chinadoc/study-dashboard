VIN-Specific Telematics and Access Control Protocols: A Technical Analysis of Stellantis 2023+ RF Ecosystems
Executive Summary: The Divergence of the Global Platform
The automotive security landscape has undergone a radical architectural shift following the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and Groupe PSA into Stellantis. For automotive locksmiths, security researchers, and systems integrators, the 2023 model year represents a "compatibility cliff." The previous assumption—that a "Dodge key is a Dodge key"—has been rendered obsolete by the integration of European platforms (STLA Small/Medium) into North American model lineups. The convergence of these distinct automotive lineages has created a complex web of Radio Frequency (RF) protocols, hardware suppliers, and cryptographic standards that can no longer be navigated by brand affiliation alone.
This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of the Radio Frequency (RF) ecosystem for Stellantis vehicles from 2023 onwards, with a specific focus on the Dodge Hornet, Jeep Renegade, and Jeep Compass. The analysis confirms that FCC IDs are no longer solely brand-dependent but are now platform- and plant-dependent, necessitating a VIN-based decoding strategy to identify the correct secure access hardware. The days of carrying a universal "Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep" proximity key are effectively over for the modern fleet.
The core finding of this research indicates a sharp bifurcation in the supply chain that directly correlates with the vehicle's manufacturing origin. On one side, the Legacy North American Architecture (NAFTA) continues to utilize Continental hardware (FCC ID: M3N family) with proprietary Rolling Code updates, maintaining a lineage that traces back to the Daimler-Chrysler era. On the other, the European/Global Architecture (EMEA/LATAM) has migrated to Giobert and Continental Europe hardware (FCC ID: 2ADPX and KR5 families), introducing HITAG-AES encryption that requires component security (CS) pre-coding.
Crucially, the "pre-coding" question in the user query is answered in the affirmative for the European-derived models. The 2023+ Dodge Hornet (built in Pomigliano d'Arco, Italy) and the 2023+ Jeep Renegade (built in Melfi, Italy) utilize transponder logic that differs fundamentally from the domestic Dodge Durango or Chrysler Pacifica. These vehicles often require keys to be ordered by VIN or pre-coded via EEPROM dump before OBDII programming can occur, fundamentally changing the service procedures for aftermarket support.


  



________________
1. The Hardware Schism: Continental vs. Giobert
To understand the VIN-specific mapping of FCC IDs, one must first dissect the hardware suppliers currently fulfilling the Stellantis contracts. Historically, Chrysler and Dodge vehicles in North America relied heavily on Continental Automotive Systems (formerly Siemens VDO) and TRW Automotive for their Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) and Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS) systems. The ubiquitous "Fobik" (Fob Integrated Key) and the later "Smart Proximity" keys predominantly bore FCC IDs starting with M3N or GQ4. These identifiers became the standard for locksmiths and technicians servicing the fleet, creating a muscle memory regarding part selection.
However, the 2023 model year data indicates a decisive shift for models sharing platforms with Fiat and Alfa Romeo. The integration of the FCA "Small Wide" platform and the "Compact Wide" platform into the North American market has brought with it the European supplier ecosystem. The introduction of Giobert S.p.A., an Italian automotive supplier based in Rivoli, Turin, as a primary vendor for the "compact" segment (Hornet, Renegade) fundamentally changes the programming logic. Giobert has long been a supplier for Fiat and Lancia, and their transponder architecture is distinct from the systems developed for the North American market.
1.1 The Continental Legacy (M3N Series)
The M3N-40821302 identifier has been the workhorse of the Dodge/Jeep lineup for nearly a decade.1 It is found on the Charger, Challenger, Durango, and older Compass models. This system represents the culmination of the "FCA US" architecture.
* Architecture: This system uses a Philips ID46 (PCF7953) or NXP AES 128-bit chip depending on the specific model year and trim level. The communication protocol typically operates on 433 MHz for global compliance, though older domestic models utilized 315 MHz.
* Programming Logic: The M3N system typically allows for "All Keys Lost" (AKL) programming via OBDII, provided the technician can bypass the Secure Gateway Module (SGW) and access the Radio Frequency Hub (RFH) PIN code. The system is designed to "learn" new keys through a handshake initiated by the diagnostic tool, where the BCM assigns a slot to the new key ID.
* Reusable Nature: These keys are often reusable if the "lock" bit is reset (unlocked) using specialized hardware.2 The aftermarket support for unlocking and refurbishing M3N keys is robust, making them readily available and cost-effective.
1.2 The Giobert Disruption (2ADPX Series)
The research identifies a new, distinct FCC ID family: 2ADPX. This prefix belongs exclusively to Giobert S.p.A..3 The presence of this Grantee Code on a key fob is a definitive indicator of a European-derived security architecture.
* Target Vehicles: The primary application for this hardware is the 2022-2024 Jeep Renegade, and by platform extension, the 2023+ Dodge Hornet.5 Regulatory filings explicitly link the FI7PE model key fob (FCC ID 2ADPXFI7PE) to both "Jeep" and "Dodge" trademarks.6
* Architecture: This system utilizes HITAG-AES (Type 4A or 6A) transponders.5 This is a significantly more advanced encryption protocol than the older ID46 crypto. The HITAG-AES protocol supports mutual authentication between the key and the vehicle using a 128-bit secret key.
* Programming Logic: This system is far more restrictive and directly validates the user's query regarding pre-coding. The "Pre-coding" hypothesis is largely correct for this hardware. The transponder cannot simply be introduced to the vehicle; it must often be pre-configured (pre-coded) with component security (CS) data specific to the vehicle's Body Control Module (BCM) or RFH before the vehicle will accept the "Learn Key" command. This data includes the specific manufacturers' code and the unique vehicle secret key.
1.3 The "Z" Factor: VIN Plant Codes
The most reliable method to distinguish between these systems without physically inspecting the key is the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). The VIN serves as a genetic marker for the vehicle's platform and, by extension, its security hardware.
* VIN Position 1 (Country of Origin):
   * 1, 2, 3 (USA/Canada/Mexico): These codes indicate assembly in the NAFTA region. Vehicles with these VINs have a high probability of retaining Continental (M3N) or TRW (GQ4) hardware. An example is the Jeep Compass built in Toluca, Mexico, which retains the M3N architecture.8
   * Z (Italy): This code indicates assembly in Italy. Vehicles with a 'Z' VIN have a high probability of using Giobert (2ADPX) or Continental Europe (KR5) hardware. This applies to the Dodge Hornet built in Pomigliano d'Arco and the Jeep Renegade built in Melfi.9
* VIN Position 11 (Assembly Plant):
   * P: Toluca, Mexico (Associated with the Compass and legacy architectures).
   * V: Melfi, Italy (Associated with the Renegade and the 2ADPX/Giobert architecture).
   * 3: Pomigliano d'Arco, Italy (Associated with the Hornet/Tonale and the KR5/2ADPX architecture).
This geographic distinction is crucial. While the brand on the grille may be American (Dodge/Jeep), the supply chain logic is strictly regional. An assembly plant in Italy sources its locksets and RF hubs from European suppliers like Giobert or Continental Automotive Europe, not from the North American suppliers used by the Detroit or Toluca plants.

2. Case Study: The Dodge Hornet (2023+)
The Dodge Hornet represents the most significant "trap" for technicians assuming continuity with previous Dodge models. It is not a "Dodge" in the traditional engineering sense; it is a re-skinned Alfa Romeo Tonale, built on the FCA Small Wide 4x4 LWB platform. This lineage dictates its security architecture and completely divorces it from the systems used in the Charger, Challenger, or Durango.
2.1 The "Phantom" Key Fob
Standard locksmith databases and parts catalogs often fail to list the Hornet correctly because it does not use the standard Dodge parts bin. The research highlights Part Number 7QV80LXHPA (or 7QV81LXHPA) as the Integrated Key Fob Transmitter for the 2023-2025 Hornet.11 This part number structure itself deviates from the typical "68xxxxxx" format seen in legacy Dodge parts, further signaling a platform shift.
Crucially, FCC ID 2ADPXFI7PE documents explicitly list the trademark as "Jeep / Dodge" in their regulatory filings.6 Given that Giobert supplies the locksets for the Hornet 13, and the FCC filing dates (2022) align perfectly with the Hornet's launch, the data strongly supports that the Hornet uses the Giobert 2ADPX system, identical to the late-model Renegade.
However, cross-platform analysis with the Alfa Romeo Tonale (its twin) suggests a potential alternative or trim-level variant using FCC ID KR5ALFA434.14 This is a Continental system used in the Giulia and Stelvio. Technicians must be prepared for either scenario, but the 2ADPX is the primary suspect for the Dodge-badged variant due to the specific regulatory filings linking Giobert to the Dodge brand mark. The presence of the "Z" VIN confirms that regardless of the specific FCC ID, the logic will be European.
2.2 Pre-Coding Requirements
The Hornet utilizes the HITAG-AES algorithm.16 Unlike the older HITAG-2 (ID46) used in the Durango, HITAG-AES keys cannot simply be taken "off the shelf" and programmed to any vehicle. The encryption relies on a pre-shared secret.
* Dealer Keys: When ordered from the dealership, these keys come pre-written with the Component Security (CS) bytes matching the specific VIN of the vehicle. They are "locked" to that car before they even arrive at the service bay.
* Aftermarket/Blank Keys: To program a blank 2ADPX or KR5 key to a Hornet, the locksmith's tool (e.g., Autel IM608, Smart Pro) must be capable of advanced cryptographic operations:
   1. Reading the Immo Data: The tool must read the CS bytes from the BCM or RFH. This often requires a "bench" connection or a specific cable to read the EEPROM data directly, as the OBDII port is guarded by the Secure Gateway.
   2. Writing the CS Data (Pre-coding): The tool writes this specific CS data to the blank transponder chip. This effectively turns the generic blank into a "Dealer Key" for that specific VIN.
   3. Key Learning: Only after pre-coding can the tool execute the key learning procedure via the OBDII port.
The user's query about "VIN-specific pre-coding" is accurate. It is not just the FCC ID that matters; the state of the transponder inside the fob is VIN-dependent. A "virgin" key with the correct FCC ID will fail to program if it has not been pre-coded with the vehicle's specific security bytes.

3. The Jeep Renegade (2022-2024): The Transition Point
The Jeep Renegade serves as the "canary in the coal mine" for the transition to Giobert hardware within the Stellantis lineup. As a vehicle produced in Melfi, Italy, alongside the Fiat 500X, the Renegade has always had European DNA, but the shift in its security architecture became absolute in the 2022-2023 model years.
3.1 The 2022 Split
Up until 2021, the Renegade predominantly used the M3N-40821302 fob, compatible with many other Jeep products.17 This allowed for a degree of cross-compatibility that locksmiths appreciated. However, the research data for 2022+ models specifically highlights the introduction of FCC ID 2ADPXFI7PE.5
* Visual Identification: The new Giobert keys may look externally identical or very similar to the older Continental keys (3-button or 4-button smart keys). This visual similarity is deceptive and dangerous for service providers, as attempting to program an M3N key to a 2ADPX system will result in repeated failures.
* The "Key Wont Turn" Anomaly: Reports of key issues in 2023 Renegades 18 often relate to the RF Hub not recognizing the fob. While mechanical binding is cited, the electronic failure of the "Start/Stop" button to respond is frequently a result of attempting to program a non-precoded M3N key to a vehicle expecting a precoded 2ADPX key. The vehicle simply does not "see" the incorrect transponder type.
3.2 The RF Hub Module (RFHM) Lock
A critical finding for 2022+ Renegades and Hornets is the "Locked" RF Hub status.19 Stellantis has implemented a security protocol where the RF Hub (the module receiving the key signal) locks itself to the programmed keys after a certain number of cycles or upon initial dealer setup.
* Implication: In an "All Keys Lost" scenario, the older methods of simply forcing a new key via PIN code often fail because the RF Hub is in a "Locked" state and will not accept new IDs. The procedure may require replacing the RF Hub entirely with a "Virgin" unit or using specialized tools (like the Autel XP400 Pro with specific cables) to unlock the module on the bench by reading and rewriting the MCU data.20 This "Lock" status is a separate layer of security on top of the pre-coding requirement, making the 2023+ Renegade one of the most difficult vehicles to service in the current lineup.
________________
4. The Jeep Compass (2023+): The Toluca Exception
While the Renegade and Hornet have moved to the Italian/Giobert ecosystem, the 2023 Jeep Compass (MP) appears to have retained the North American/Continental architecture. This is a critical distinction that is explained by the manufacturing footprint. North American Compass units are manufactured in Toluca, Mexico 22, a plant deeply integrated into the NAFTA supply chain.
4.1 Persistence of M3N
Multiple vendor listings and technical sheets for the 2023 Compass cite FCC ID M3N-40821302.8 This confirms that the Compass has not migrated to the Giobert system used by its platform-mates in Italy.
* Significance: This means a 2023 Compass is likely easier to program than a 2023 Hornet. It utilizes the standard Philips 46 or NXP AES logic that most locksmith tools handle natively via OBDII. The continuity of the M3N FCC ID suggests that the Toluca plant continues to source its RF Hubs and Keys from the established North American suppliers (Continental).
* Frequency: It operates on 433 MHz 23, which is standard for global platforms, but the protocol remains consistent with the "Legacy" group.
4.2 The Pre-Coding Nuance
While the Compass uses the older FCC ID, technicians should be wary of the Secure Gateway (SGW). All 2023 Compasses will have an SGW that blocks aftermarket tools from clearing codes or adding keys via OBDII unless an authorized bridge (AutoAuth) or a physical bypass cable is used.24 However, unlike the Hornet, the Compass keys generally do not require the intense "pre-coding" procedure on the bench; they can usually be programmed directly via OBDII once the SGW is bypassed.
________________
5. Technical Synthesis: The "Pre-Coding" Mechanism
To definitively answer the user's query: It is not just the same FCC ID with different coding. In the case of the Hornet and Renegade, it is a different FCC ID (2ADPX) and a different coding scheme (HITAG-AES). For the Compass, it is the same FCC ID (M3N) but potential firmware updates in the RF Hub enforce stricter rolling code synchronization.
5.1 Understanding HITAG-AES Pre-Coding
The shift to HITAG-AES (128-bit) on the Giobert fobs introduces a "Secret Key" (SK) concept that fundamentally changes the handshake between the key and the car.
* Traditional (Hitag 2): In older systems, simple PIN code access allowed the vehicle to learn the key ID. The security was largely unidirectional.
* New (Hitag AES): The key and the vehicle (BCM/RFH) must share a pre-shared Secret Key before the learning process begins.
   * Dealer Scenario: The key is ordered from the factory. The factory writes the specific SK for VIN #12345 into the key based on their central database. When the key arrives, the dealer tool simply introduces them, verifying the SK matches.
   * Aftermarket Scenario: A "Virgin" key has a blank or default SK. The locksmith tool must first read the SK from the car's BCM (often requiring a bypass cable or bench connection), write it to the blank key (Pre-coding), and then program it. The vehicle will reject any key that does not already "know" the secret.


  



________________
6. Regulatory & Compliance Context
The shift to FCC ID 2ADPXFI7PE is not arbitrary; it aligns Stellantis's global supply chain. The underlying supplier, Giobert, is a long-time partner of Fiat and Alfa Romeo. As Dodge absorbs Alfa Romeo architectures (Hornet = Tonale), the supply chain naturally follows.
6.1 Regulatory Filings
The regulatory trail provides the most concrete evidence of this hardware shift. Filings for FCC ID 2ADPXFI7PE reveal the following:
* Applicant: Giobert S.p.A., Rivoli, Italy.
* Product: "Keyfob FI7PE".
* Frequency: 434 MHz (European Standard, adopted for US global platforms).
* Compliance: FCC Part 15 (USA) and ISED (Canada).
This confirms that the hardware is imported directly from the Italian supply lines, bypassing the traditional North American suppliers like Strattec or Continental US. The explicit listing of "Dodge" as a trademark on these filings 6 is the smoking gun that links the 2ADPX system to the Hornet, confirming the platform sharing at the deepest hardware level.
6.2 The "Locked" RF Hub Recall (CSN Z23)
Technicians must be aware of Customer Satisfaction Notification Z23.26 This campaign involved replacing RF Hubs on thousands of vehicles to prevent key cloning.
* Impact: Vehicles with the "Z23" update or newer RF Hubs are significantly harder to program. The hub creates a "lockdown" state that rejects new keys unless a specific "Replace RF Hub" routine is run in the diagnostic software.26 This is often mistaken for a wrong FCC ID or bad key, but it is actually a firmware-level blockage. The Z23 update specifically targets the vulnerability that allowed unauthenticated keys to be added, reinforcing the need for the authenticated "Pre-coding" workflow.
________________
7. Conclusions and Recommendations
The 2023+ Stellantis landscape is defined by platform origin. The user's hypothesis regarding VIN-specific mapping is confirmed, but the mechanism is a combination of Hardware Divergence and Cryptographic Pre-coding.
Key Takeaways:
1. Dodge Hornet (2023+): Uses Giobert hardware (FCC ID: 2ADPXFI7PE) or Alfa hardware (FCC ID: KR5ALFA434). It requires HITAG-AES pre-coding. It is not compatible with Dodge Durango/Charger keys (M3N).
2. Jeep Renegade (2022+): Has migrated to Giobert (FCC ID: 2ADPXFI7PE). Requires pre-coding.
3. Jeep Compass (2023): Likely retains Continental (FCC ID: M3N-40821302), primarily due to its Mexican production origin, but vigilance is required for "Global" trim levels which may switch.
4. The "VIN Rule":
   * VIN starts with "Z" (Italy): Expect Giobert/2ADPX (Pre-coding required).
   * VIN starts with "1/2/3" (NAFTA): Expect Continental/M3N (Legacy programming).
Actionable Strategy for Technicians:
* Verify VIN Origin: Before quoting a job, check the first digit of the VIN. This is the single most important diagnostic step.
* Identify the RF Hub: Use a diagnostic tool to read the RF Hub part number. If it ends in a high revision (e.g., "AM" or later), expect the "Locked" protocol.26
* Stock the New Hardware: The legacy M3N keys will not work on the Hornet or new Renegade. Inventory of 2ADPX and KR5 keys is now mandatory for any shop servicing modern Stellantis vehicles.
* Invest in Bypass Hardware: A "12+8" Secure Gateway Bypass cable or a direct "Star Connector" cable is non-negotiable for communicating with these 2018+ architectures.
The convergence of European security standards into the American market is complete. The "Dodge" Hornet is, electronically speaking, an Italian exotic, and it demands to be treated with the same procedural rigor as an Alfa Romeo.

	8.3 The "Universal" Key Myth
A common misconception found in online forums 28 is that a universal "Dodge" key will work on the Hornet. This is false.
* Frequency Mismatch: While both M3N and 2ADPX systems often operate at 433 MHz, the Modulation Scheme (FSK vs. ASK) and Data Packet Structure differ.
* Transponder Mismatch: The M3N system typically looks for a Philips Crypto 2 (ID46) or a specific NXP AES configuration. The Hornet's BCM is scanning for a HITAG-AES (Type 4A/6A) challenge-response. A standard Dodge key will not even be detected by the Hornet's coil.
________________
9. Advanced Programming Procedures
For the professional locksmith utilizing tools such as the Autel IM608, Smart Pro, or Zed-Full, the approach to these vehicles requires specific protocols.
9.1 Bypassing the Secure Gateway (SGW)
As confirmed by multiple sources 24, all 2018+ Stellantis vehicles are equipped with an SGW.
* Method A (AutoAuth): The preferred software solution. The diagnostic tool must be registered with AutoAuth to digitally authenticate with the Stellantis server via Wi-Fi. This grants "write" access to the BCM/RFH.
* Method B (Physical Bypass): Using a "12+8" cable 30 or "Star Connector" cable. This involves physically disconnecting the SGW module (often located behind the radio or under the steering column) and plugging the tool directly into the CAN bus. Note: On the Hornet/Renegade, access to the SGW can be difficult, making AutoAuth the more efficient route.
9.2 The "All Keys Lost" (AKL) Protocol for Hornet/Renegade
In an AKL scenario for the Italian-built models (2ADPX system), the procedure is significantly more invasive than for domestic models.
1. Immo Data Extraction: The tool must read the encrypted Immobilizer Data (CS Bytes, MAC, PIN) from the RF Hub or BCM. This may require an APB112 emulator or similar specific adapter if the reading cannot be done via OBDII.
2. Dealer Key Generation: Once the Immo Data is obtained, it must be written to a virgin 2ADPX-compatible key. This process "pre-codes" the key, effectively turning it into a "Dealer Key" specific to that VIN.
3. Key Learning: Only after the key is pre-coded can the standard "Learn Key" OBDII command be executed.
Warning: Attempting to program a standard, non-precoded "unlocked" key to a Hornet will result in a "Security Access Denied" or "Key Not Recognized" error, even if the frequency and FCC ID on the shell match. The invisible data structure inside the chip is the determining factor.
________________
10. Future Outlook: The Digital Key & UWB
Looking beyond 2024, the Stellantis roadmap indicates a further shift toward Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and Phone-as-a-Key (PaaK) systems.31
* Digital Key Control Module (DKCM): Newer models are introducing the DKCM, which works in parallel with the RF Hub.
* Impact on Repairs: If a DKCM is replaced, new NFC cards must be issued, and the customer's phone must be re-registered. This moves the "key" concept entirely into the software domain, potentially bypassing the traditional FCC ID hardware constraints but introducing new software licensing hurdles for independent repair shops.
The Dodge Hornet, with its modern architecture, is likely one of the first mass-market Dodge vehicles to support these features fully, further distancing it from the legacy Charger/Challenger ecosystem.

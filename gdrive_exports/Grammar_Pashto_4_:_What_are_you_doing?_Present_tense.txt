12. byaa sara weenum / weenoo.
When you are finished, check your answers on the last page. Ask your teacher if you have questions.


Direction tsalor 4: Practice pronouncing the difference between kawe and kawee. Repeat after your teacher. Then practice repeating the following sentences after your teacher.
1. tsu kawe?                =        “What are you doing?”
2. tsu kawee?                =         “What are they doing?”
3. tsu pakhawe?                =        “What are you cooking?”
4. tsu pakhawee?                =        “What are they cooking?
5. tsu khore?                =        “What are you eating?”
6. tsu khoree?                =        “What are they eating?”


Now your teacher will read one of the sentences above. If the sentence ends with 1 “e” hold up 1 finger. If the sentence ends with 2 “e’s” hold up 2 fingers. 

Direction pindzu 5: Ask and answer the questions from direction dre with your partner. As you get more comfortable, only the person asking the question should look at the paper. The person answering should try to answer from memory!


________________
Direction shpag 6. Personalize the sentences in direction dre by replacing the bold words with your own words. Use your Pashto dictionary, double check the answers with your teacher, and then practice asking and answering the questions again.  As you get more comfortable, only the person asking the question should look at the paper. 


Grammar Note: Remember the present tense can talk either about things happening right now OR things that happen generally. So, “wreeje pakhawum” could mean either “I cook rice [regularly, normally]” or “I am cooking rice [right now].”  This means you can use it in a wide variety of settings and situations!


Direction owu 7: Take turns asking and answering questions about your partner’s brother/sister/father/mother etc using the sentences from direction dre. Remember to change the verb endings to use the 2 “e’s” for example:
Student A: wror de tsu kawee?
Student B: wror me pakhley kawee.

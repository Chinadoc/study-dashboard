Global Automotive Key System Specifications and Immobilizer Architecture: A Definitive Reference for Security Professionals
1. Introduction: The Technical Evolution of Vehicle Access
The domain of automotive security has undergone a metamorphosis that parallels the broader digital revolution. What began as a purely mechanical discipline—governed by the physics of shear lines, tumble pins, and sidebars—has evolved into a complex branch of cryptography and embedded systems engineering. For the modern locksmith, automotive technician, and security analyst, the "key" is no longer defined merely by its bitting; it is defined by its transponder logic, its frequency modulation protocols, and its interaction with the vehicle’s Body Control Module (BCM).
This report serves as an exhaustive reference for automotive key systems worldwide. It synthesizes data from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) such as Strattec, aftermarket leaders like Ilco and Silca, and regulatory filings to provide a granular analysis of mechanical and electronic specifications. The scope includes a detailed examination of mechanical keyways, transponder chip architectures (from fixed code to 128-bit AES), and Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) / Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS) protocols.
1.1 The Trajectory of Immobilization Technology
The shift from mechanical access to electronic verification was driven by rising vehicle theft rates in the late 20th century. Early implementations were rudimentary. General Motors’ Vehicle Anti-Theft System (VATS), introduced in the 1986 Corvette, utilized a simple resistor pellet embedded in the key blade.1 The vehicle’s decoder module measured the voltage drop across the pellet; if it matched the programmed value (1 through 15), the starter relay was engaged. While primitive by modern standards, VATS reduced Corvette theft by nearly 90% and established the paradigm of the key as an active component of the vehicle's electrical system.
The industry rapidly moved toward Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The first generation of transponders (e.g., Megamos ID13, T5) utilized low-frequency (LF) magnetic induction to power a passive chip, which then broadcast a static alphanumeric string. This "Fixed Code" era was short-lived due to the ease of "replay attacks"—cloning a key by simply reading and writing its static code. This vulnerability necessitated the development of "Rolling Code" or "Crypto" transponders (e.g., Texas Instruments 4C/4D, Philips ID46), where the vehicle and key exchange a changing mathematical challenge and response.2
Today, the standard is the PEPS system, often referred to as the "Smart Key." These systems maintain a continuous, bi-directional dialogue with the vehicle using multiple antennas. The vehicle wakes the key using a Low Frequency (LF) 125 kHz signal, and the key responds on an Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) band (315 MHz or 433 MHz).3 This architecture introduces new complexities, including battery dependency, interference issues, and the need for emergency mechanical backups.


  



1.2 Geographic and Regulatory Constraints
A critical, often overlooked variable in automotive specifications is the regulatory environment. The frequency at which a remote operates is dictated by regional spectrum allocations.
* North America (FCC/IC): The Federal Communications Commission (USA) and Industry Canada typically allocate the 315 MHz band for automotive RKE systems. However, newer high-bandwidth systems are migrating to 902 MHz.
* Europe (CE) and Asia: The standard frequency is 433.92 MHz.
* Niche Applications: Certain high-security European systems (e.g., BMW CAS systems) utilize 868 MHz to avoid interference in crowded urban environments.
This geographic fragmentation means that a 2015 Ford Focus manufactured for the German market is physically incompatible with a 2015 Ford Focus manufactured for the US market, despite sharing the same chassis and body control architecture. The US model will utilize a 315 MHz receiver, while the German model will utilize 433 MHz. Locksmiths must verify the origin of the vehicle—often via the VIN or door jamb stickers—before attempting to program a remote.5
2. Fundamentals of Mechanical Keyways and Blank Identification
Before the electronic handshake can occur, the physical interface—the keyway—must be successfully navigated. Even in the era of "Phone-as-a-Key," the mechanical blade remains the ultimate fail-safe, concealed within every smart fob to allow entry when the vehicle battery dies. Understanding the taxonomy of key blanks is the foundational skill of the automotive locksmith.
2.1 The Taxonomy of Key Blanks
The global key blank industry relies on specific numbering systems to categorize the thousands of profiles in existence. The primary naming conventions are maintained by Kaba Ilco (North America), Silca (Europe/Global), and JMA (Europe/Global). Additional OEM-specific numbering is provided by Strattec, the primary lock supplier for GM, Ford, and Chrysler.
* Ilco Numbering: The North American standard. A typical automotive key might be designated as H75 (Ford) or TR47 (Toyota). The system often uses suffixes to denote material or features:
   * P: Plastic Head (e.g., H75-P).
   * PT: Plastic Head with Transponder (e.g., H72-PT).
   * G: Specific transponder generation (e.g., TOY44G-PT).
* Silca References: Dominant in international markets. Silca references typically use a two-letter manufacturer code followed by a number (e.g., TOY43 for Toyota, HU66 for Volkswagen, SIP22 for Fiat). This system is highly logical and groups keys by blade profile families.6
* Strattec: As an OEM supplier, Strattec part numbers (e.g., 5923667 for a Ford fob) refer to the original finished good. These are cross-referenced to Ilco numbers for the aftermarket. Strattec catalogs are the gold standard for identifying the correct service tumblers and ignition cylinders for domestic vehicles.8
2.2 Blade Profiles and Milling Architectures
Automotive locks generally fall into two categories based on their internal mechanism and milling type: Edge Cuts and High Security (Laser).
2.2.1 Edge Cut Systems (Wafer Locks)
Edge keys rely on cuts milled into the top and/or bottom edge of the blade. These interact with wafer tumblers inside the lock cylinder.
* Single-Sided: Cuts on one side only. (Obsolete in most modern cars, common in pre-1990s).
* Double-Sided: Cuts on both top and bottom, allowing the key to be inserted either way up.
   * Example: Ford H75 (8-Cut). Used on the F-150 from 1996 to 2014. It uses 8 cut positions with 5 depth possibilities. The wafers are arranged in an alternating pattern.10
   * Example: Chrysler Y159. A double-sided key used on countless Jeep and Dodge vehicles. It is known for being robust but the wafers in the ignition are prone to wear, often allowing the key to be removed while the vehicle is running.11
2.2.2 High Security "Laser" Tracks
"Laser" or "Sidewinder" keys feature a milled track running along the flat face of the blade rather than edge cuts. This design offers higher precision, greater pick resistance, and reduced wear on the key bitting (though often increased wear on the wafers themselves).
* Internal Track (channel): The milling is inside a rectangular channel.
   * Example: GM Z-Keyway (HU100). Used on the Camaro, Cruze, and Malibu. The track is internal, protecting it from dirt and damage.12
   * Example: VW HU66. The standard VAG key for two decades.
* External Track: The track is cut into the side of the blade, leaving a distinct ridge.
   * Example: Honda HO01 (HON66). Used on almost all Honda vehicles since 2002. This keyway is notoriously sensitive to wear. The "split" wafers in Honda locks jam easily if the key is worn or poorly duplicated.11
2.3 Universal Keyway Cross-Reference Matrix
Locksmiths must frequently translate between these numbering systems depending on their supplier. The following table provides a comprehensive cross-reference for the most common global keyways.

	3. Transponder Technology: The Invisible Security Layer
While the blade turns the lock, the transponder starts the engine. The integration of the transponder chip into the key head created a dual-authentication system. If the Immobilizer Control Unit (ICU) does not detect a valid cryptographically signed response from the key's chip, fuel and spark are disabled.
3.1 Transponder Generations and Chip ID
The industry categorizes transponders by their communication protocol and encryption method. Locksmiths identify these chips using IDs (e.g., ID46, ID48) or manufacturer designations (e.g., Philips Crypto 2, Texas 4D).
3.1.1 Fixed Code (The First Generation)
Early chips like the Megamos ID13 and T5 varieties broadcast a static alphanumeric string. These provided basic protection but were vulnerable to "sniffing" and cloning. They were common in early GM (Passkey III), Honda (pre-2002), and Volvo vehicles.18
3.1.2 Encrypted Rolling Code (Crypto)
To combat cloning, manufacturers introduced rolling codes.
* Texas Instruments 4C/4D: Widely used by Ford, Toyota, and Nissan. The 4D chip (40-bit or 80-bit) introduced a challenge-response mechanism. Toyota's evolution from 4C (fixed) to 4D-67 (crypto) to G-Chip (80-bit) and finally H-Chip (128-bit AES) illustrates the constant arms race.20
* Philips Crypto (ID46): The standard for GM (Circle Plus), Honda, Nissan, and Kia/Hyundai for over a decade. The ID46 chip uses the PCF7936 integrated circuit and requires a specific "sniffing" procedure to clone, capturing data from the ignition coil during a start attempt.17
* Megamos Crypto (ID48): The backbone of the Volkswagen Audi Group (VAG). The ID48 chip is notorious for its difficulty in cloning due to the complex proprietary encryption used in VW's CAN-bus systems. Newer ID48 "96-bit" versions require high-power server calculation to decipher.22
3.1.3 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
Modern systems, such as Toyota's "H" chip and the newest VAG "MQB" systems, utilize 128-bit AES encryption. These chips, such as the 8A (Toyota/Hyundai) and MQB ID88 (VW), are extremely difficult to clone and often require programming directly to the vehicle via OBD2 using authorized credentials or NASTF (National Automotive Service Task Force) codes.24


  



4. Manufacturer-Specific Technical Analysis: North American Domestic
The "Big Three" (Ford, GM, Chrysler/Stellantis) have historically set the pace for North American security standards. While they have distinct architectures, they share common suppliers (Strattec) and trends (migration to high-security keys).
4.1 Ford / Lincoln / Mercury
Ford's security evolution is highly structured, moving from the Passive Anti-Theft System (PATS) to the current Intelligent Access (PEPS).
4.1.1 Mechanical and Transponder Systems (Legacy)
From 1996 to approximately 2014, Ford relied on the H75 (8-cut) keyway. The security logic, however, evolved internally.
* PATS 1 & 2 (Texas 4C): The earliest systems used a glass or carbon fixed-code 4C transponder. These keys are recognizable by their bulky heads. They cannot be programmed via On-Board Programming (OBP) if no working keys are available; diagnostic tools are required.
* PATS 3 & CAN (Texas 4D-63 40-bit): In the early 2000s, Ford switched to the "Blue Chip" (often glass) 4D-63 40-bit crypto chip. This system allowed for "On-Board Programming" (OBP): if the user had two working keys, they could program a third by cycling the ignition.26
* 80-Bit Encryption (Texas 4D-63 80-bit): Around 2010-2011, Ford upgraded the 4D-63 chip to 80-bit encryption. Critical Note: The physical key blank (H75) remained the same, and the chip looks identical. However, an 80-bit key is backward compatible with a 40-bit vehicle, but a 40-bit key will not work on an 80-bit vehicle. Locksmiths identify these by the "SA" or "HA" stamp on the blade.27
4.1.2 The High Security and PEPS Era (2015+)
Starting with the 2015 F-150 and Fusion, Ford transitioned to the HU101 laser keyway and Hitag Pro (128-bit) transponders.
* Smart Keys: The N5F-A08TAA (FCC ID) fob is the standard for the F-150 (2015-2020). It operates at 902 MHz (high bandwidth) or 315 MHz depending on trim. The emergency blade is the HU101.
* Part Numbers: Strattec provides the OEM parts. For the 2015-2020 F-150, the 3-button flip key part number is 164-R8130. The proximity fob is 164-R8134.28

	4.2 General Motors (Chevrolet / GMC / Cadillac)
GM's ecosystem is vast, covering everything from the Geo Metro to the Cadillac Escalade. The unifying thread is the use of the Philips Crypto architecture (Circle Plus) and the more recent high-security HU100 blade.
4.2.1 The "Circle Plus" (+) Standard
For nearly a decade (roughly 2006-2015), the B106 (Ilco) or Z-Keyway was the standard.
* Identification: These keys are stamped with a small + inside a circle on the blade near the head. This indicates the presence of a Philips ID46 (PCF7936) chip.
* Programming: GM vehicles from this era are famous for their "On-Board" programming procedure. A new key could be added by inserting it and leaving the ignition in the "ON" position for 10 minutes (until the security light went out), repeating this cycle three times (30 minutes total). This "30-Minute Relearn" allowed users to program keys without tools.11
4.2.2 The "High Feature" / PEPS Evolution
Modern GM vehicles (Camaro, Cruze, Equinox, Silverado) utilize the HU100 laser blade.
* Flip Keys: The 5-button flip key (FCC OHT01060512) is ubiquitous. The blade (HU100) is cut on a specialized milling machine. The transponder is integrated into the remote PCB (Remote Keyless Entry and Immobilizer are one unit). If the battery dies, the key still starts the car via induction, but the remote functions cease.
* Smart Keys (HYQ Series): The newest generation (2017+) uses high-frequency fobs. For example, the 2019+ Silverado uses FCC HYQ1ES or HYQ1AA. These operate at 433 MHz or 315 MHz and require strictly OBD2 programming; the manual "30-minute" method has been removed from most newer PEPS vehicles.10
4.3 Chrysler / Dodge / Jeep (Stellantis)
Chrysler's system, known as SKIM (Sentry Key Immobilizer Module) or WIN (Wireless Ignition Node), has seen drastic physical changes.
* The Metal Head Era (Y159): Early 2000s models (Ram, Jeep) used a gray/tan head key (Y160-PT) with a 4D-64 or ID46 chip.
* The Fobik Era: In 2008, Chrysler introduced the "Fobik" (Fob Integrated Key). This rectangular remote had no metal blade visible; the plastic tip was inserted into the dash. It utilized the Philips ID46 protocol. (FCC IYZ-C01C).
* The Proximity Era: Current models use a "Pod" key or Smart Fob (FCC GQ4-53T). The mechanical emergency key is the Y159 profile.
* Security Gateway (SGW): Starting in 2018, Chrysler introduced the SGW module, which blocks unauthorized OBD2 tools from writing data to the car. Locksmiths must now use an "AutoAuth" subscription or a physical "12+8" bypass cable to program keys for 2018+ Ram, Jeep, and Dodge vehicles.10
5. Manufacturer-Specific Technical Analysis: Asian Imports
Asian manufacturers, particularly Toyota and Honda, have led the way in transponder reliability and complexity. Their systems are characterized by very specific chip iterations.
5.1 Toyota / Lexus / Scion
Toyota's ecosystem is perhaps the most strictly regimented. The transponder type is often physically stamped on the key blade, providing an instant visual identifier for the locksmith.
5.1.1 The "Dot", "G", and "H" Evolution
* Dot (.) Stamp (2005-2010): Indicates a Texas 4D-67 chip (40-bit). These are widely clonable.
* G Stamp (2010-2014): Indicates a Texas 4D-72 "G" chip (80-bit). This marked a security upgrade. While they use the same TR47 keyway, a "Dot" key cannot program to a "G" car.14
* H Stamp (2014-2019): Indicates the Toyota "H" Chip (128-bit AES / ID 8A). This chip is much more secure. For "All Keys Lost" situations, this often requires resetting the immobilizer using a seed-code calculator or specialized dongle.15
5.1.2 Smart Key "Page 1" Data
For Toyota Smart Keys (Prox), the external case often looks identical across models (e.g., the HYQ14FBA fob). However, the internal board differs. Locksmiths identify the correct fob by reading "Page 1" of the transponder data (e.g., 94, 98, 88, A8, A9).
* Example: A 2016 RAV4 might use a board with Page 1 88. A 2018 Camry might use Page 1 A8. Using the wrong board will result in a failed programming attempt, even if the FCC ID matches.
* Emergency Blades: Smart keys use the LXP90 (High Security) or TOY48 blade.

	5.2 Honda / Acura
Honda has traditionally utilized the Philips ID46 architecture but is notable for its specific mechanical vulnerabilities.
* The "Laser Key" Problem (HO01): The Honda high-security key (HO01 / HON66) uses an external sidewinder cut. The wafers in the ignition cylinder are prone to wear and deformation. It is extremely common for High Mileage Hondas (2003-2012) to have ignitions that seize. Locksmiths often must rebuild the ignition with new wafers rather than just cutting a new key.11
* Transponders:
   * ID13 (Megamos): Pre-2003. Fixed code.
   * ID46 (Philips): 2003-2013. The standard. Often stamped with V (Valet) or L (Lock).
   * ID47 (Honda G): 2014+. Used in Push-to-Start systems (Civic, Pilot, Accord).
* Driver Memory System: Acura and high-trim Honda smart fobs are designated "Driver 1" and "Driver 2" (e.g., KR5V44). The vehicle's BCM recognizes the specific fob ID and adjusts mirrors/seats accordingly. When replacing a lost fob, the locksmith must ensure the new fob matches the missing slot (Driver 1 or 2) to avoid conflicts.32
5.3 Hyundai / Kia: The PIN Code and "Kia Boys"
Hyundai and Kia utilize a programming logic that requires a specific PIN Code (usually 6 digits) assigned to the VIN.
* The PIN System: To program a key, the locksmith must query the BCM for the PIN or purchase it from a database service (NASTF). Without this PIN, the diagnostic tool cannot enter "Learning Mode."
* Transponders: They have moved from ID46 to Hitag AES (4A) and 8A smart keys.
* The Theft Controversy: A significant subset of 2011-2021 Hyundai/Kia models in the US market (turn-key ignitions) were shipped without immobilizers. This allowed the "Kia Boys" exploit where the ignition cylinder could be bypassed mechanically, and the car started without any transponder authentication. Models with Push-to-Start buttons always had immobilizers and were immune to this specific attack.21
6. Manufacturer-Specific Technical Analysis: European Markets
European security systems are characterized by high encryption standards and "Dealer Key" protocols.
6.1 Volkswagen / Audi (VAG)
The VAG Group uses the Megamos Crypto (ID48) platform, evolved through several generations (Immo 1 through Immo 5/MQB).
* Component Security (CS): Unlike Ford or Toyota where a blank chip is programmed to the car, VAG cars require the chip to be "pre-coded" with 7 (or more) bytes of Component Security data before it can be learned. This creates a "Dealer Key."
* MQB Platform: The modern Modularer Querbaukasten (MQB) platform (Golf Mk7, Audi A3 2015+) uses AES-128 encryption. The keys (FCC 5G0 959 752) are extremely difficult to clone. Programming requires reading the CS data from the instrument cluster or engine ECU, often necessitating complex EEPROM work or authorized server connections.22
6.2 BMW
BMW's EWS (Elektronische Wegfahrsperre) and CAS (Car Access System) are industry benchmarks.
* Frequencies: BMWs use 315 MHz (US/Japan), 433 MHz (Europe), and significantly, 868 MHz (Europe/High Traffic) to avoid interference.
* Rechargeable Keys: Many BMW "Diamond" keys (E46 era) and Smart Fobs contain a rechargeable Panasonic VL2020 vanadium-lithium battery that charges via induction in the ignition slot. A common failure mode is the death of this non-replaceable battery.33
* CAS Modules: The CAS module stores the ISN (Individual Serial Number). Making a key requires reading this ISN. If the CAS module firmware is updated by the dealer (e.g., ISTA-P update), it often locks out aftermarket programmers (like the VVDI2), requiring a "downgrade" of the firmware to make a key.
7. The Aftermarket Ecosystem: Generation and Cloning
The aftermarket response to these complex systems has been the development of "Universal" solutions that reduce inventory complexity.
7.1 The Universal Remote Revolution
Instead of stocking thousands of expensive OEM fobs, locksmiths now utilize "Universal Remotes" from companies like KeyDIY and Xhorse.
* Mechanism: A universal remote (e.g., Xhorse "Super Remote") contains a blank, rewriteable firmware chip. Using a tool like the KeyDIY KD-X2 or VVDI Key Tool Max, the locksmith "burns" the specific logic of a Ford N5F-A08TAA or Honda KR5V44 onto the universal board. The car sees the remote as an OEM part.34
* Coverage: These tools support thousands of models, including Ford, GM, Honda, Toyota, VW, and Hyundai. They can generate both the remote functions (RKE) and the transponder logic.36
7.2 Super Chips
The Xhorse XT27 Super Chip is a single carbon-wedge transponder that can be programmed to emulate almost any transponder type:
* ID11/12/13 (Fixed)
* ID46 (Philips)
* ID48 (Megamos)
* 4C/4D/8A (Texas/Toyota)
This allows a locksmith to carry one bag of chips instead of separate stock for every manufacturer.37


  



8. Conclusion
The automotive key has evolved from a simple brass component to a sophisticated node in the vehicle's cybersecurity network. For the automotive security professional, mastery requires a confluence of skills: the mechanical precision to cut a laser key, the electronic knowledge to identify transponder encryption, and the digital literacy to navigate OBD2 programming interfaces. As manufacturers push toward even higher security standards—such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and Phone-as-a-Key—the aftermarket will continue to adapt, leveraging tools like universal generators and super chips to maintain the delicate balance between security and serviceability.

The Application Guide is broken down into two major sections:  Key Applications and Lock Applications. The sections 
are organized alphabetically by make, model and year. The Key Application section includes on-board programming 
instructions, Remote applications and a detailed key listing.
To find a key for a Chevrolet Silverado you’d look under Key Applications. Next, find the Chevrolet listings. Under 
Chevrolet find the year on the left and locate the vehicle name alphabetically. To find a lock for a Ford Fusion you’d 
look under Lock Applications. Next find the Ford listings. Under Ford find the year on the left and locate the vehicle 
name alphabetically.
It is essential to obtain the proper year, make and model information from your customer. Should you discover a 
discrepancy, recheck the information and/or check one model year ahead or behind to cover mid-year introductions.

Simple mechanical auto locks are rapidly losing ground to the next generation of lock technology — transponder 
keys. In this innovative system, an electronic chip (the transponder) imbedded in the key transmits and verifies a 
code with the car’s on-board computer systems, allowing the car to start. If someone attempts to start the vehicle 
without the correct programmed key the car will not start.
HOW A TRANSPONDER KEY WORKS.
And Why It Can Work Wonders For Y our Business.
Transponder technology represents a major advance in theft protection — and a profitable opportunity for you. Since 
its introduction in 1996, transponder key use has grown to over 100 million cars in North America today. And with 
replacement costs currently averaging $50 to $300 per key, your reward in servicing the technology will match the 
vehicle owner’s satisfaction of being protected by it.

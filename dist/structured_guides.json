    "Volkswagen Jetta (2011-2018)": {
        "overview": "The 2011-2018 VW Jetta with PEPS/KESSY (proximity/keyless) uses the **NEC+24C64 (UDS)** instrument cluster system. Unlike older systems, AKL on these vehicles **cannot be done purely via OBD-II** — bench work is required to access the cluster's EEPROM and generate a service mode file.",
        "preparation": "### Required Tools\n- **Autel IM608** with XP400 Pro OR **VVDI2** with VVDI Prog\n- **SOIC8 Pogo Pin Adapter** (strongly recommended over test clips)\n- **Fiberglass Scratch Brush** for conformal coating removal\n- **T20 Torx** and plastic trim tools for cluster removal\n- **Stable 12V Power Supply** for bench programming\n\n### Why OBD-Only Fails\nThe immobilizer data is encrypted in the cluster's EEPROM. The cluster must be physically accessed to read/write the 24C64 chip and generate a 'Service Mode' file that temporarily unlocks key programming.",
        "procedure": "### Phase 1: Remove the Instrument Cluster\n1. Disconnect the battery and wait 5 minutes.\n2. Remove the steering column covers (T20 Torx screws).\n3. Pull down the cluster hood trim panel.\n4. Remove the 4 cluster mounting screws.\n5. Disconnect the electrical connector and carefully extract the cluster.\n\n### Phase 2: Expose EEPROM Contacts\n1. Remove the cluster's rear cover (clips around perimeter).\n2. Locate the **24C64 EEPROM** chip on the PCB.\n3. Use a fiberglass scratch brush to remove conformal coating from the chip legs.\n4. Clean residue with IPA.\n\n### Phase 3: Bench Read/Write\n1. Connect the **SOIC8 pogo pin adapter** to the 24C64 chip.\n2. Using Autel IM608: Navigate to **VW → IMMO → Cluster Bench Mode**.\n3. Read the original EEPROM dump and **SAVE A BACKUP**.\n4. Generate the 'Service Mode' file.\n5. Write the service file back to the EEPROM.\n\n### Phase 4: Reinstall & Program Key\n1. Reinstall the cluster in the vehicle.\n2. Reconnect the battery.\n3. Connect programmer to OBD-II port.\n4. Navigate to **VW → IMMO → Add Dealer Key → KESSY**.\n5. For KESSY: Hold the smart key against the **emergency start coil** (left side of steering column) when prompted to 'Turn Ignition ON'.\n6. Follow on-screen prompts to complete key learning.",
        "notes": "### KESSY-Specific Tips\n💡 **Emergency Start Location**: The KESSY emergency start coil is on the left side of the steering column. Hold the key fob directly against it when prompted.\n\n### Tool Comparison\n| Tool | AKL Capable? | Method |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| Autel IM608 | ✅ Yes | Bench + OBD |\n| VVDI2 + Prog | ✅ Yes | Bench + OBD |\n| AVDI/Abrites | ✅ Yes | Bench + Online |\n| Smart Pro | ⚠️ Limited | Requires PIN |\n| Force Ignition | ❌ No | Won't bypass encryption |\n\n⚠️ **Warning**: Force ignition tools do NOT work on this system — the issue is encryption, not power.\n\n🔗 **Full Walkthrough**: [View Detailed Procedure](/assets/walkthroughs/vw_jetta_peps_akl.html)\n\n### Compatible Vehicles\nThis same NEC+24C64 procedure applies to:\n- VW Golf (2010-2014)\n- VW Beetle (2012-2019)\n- VW Tiguan (2009-2017)\n- VW Passat US (2012-2015)\n- VW CC (2009-2017)\n- VW Eos (2007-2016)\n- Audi A3 8P (2006-2013)"

        "overview": "The Ford F-150 (2015-2020) utilizes a proximity-based smart key system (8A chip). Programming can be completed via OBD-II using tools like Autel IM508/IM608 or AutoProPAD.",
        "preparation": "1. **Tools Required**: Autel IM508/IM608 with XP400 (if CAS/EWS), or AutoProPAD.\n2. **Programming Slot**: The programming slot is located at the bottom of the center console cup holder. Remove the rubber cover to reveal the slot.\n3. **Vehicle Prep**: Ensure the vehicle battery is stable (use a maintainer if possible). Turn off all accessories (lights, AC).",
        "procedure": "### Add Smart Key (with 1 working key)\n1. Connect the programmer to the OBD-II port.\n2. Navigate to: **Ford -> Manual Selection -> F-150 -> 2015-2020 -> Smart Key**.\n3. Select **Hot Function -> Add Smart Key**.\n4. Place the working key in the center console slot.\n5. Follow the on-screen prompts; the programmer will read the IMMO data.\n6. When prompted, remove the working key and insert the **NEW** smart key into the slot.\n7. The programmer will signal 'Learning Success' once complete.\n\n### All Keys Lost (AKL)\n1. Connect to OBD-II and select **All Keys Lost**.\n2. The system will perform a 10-minute security bypass (Flash/Wait).\n3. Follow the instructions to place the NO. 1 key in the slot, then the NO. 2 key.",
        "notes": "💡 **Tip**: If the ignition won't turn on, ensure the key is placed correctly in the cup holder slot.\n⚠️ **Warning**: Always verify the part number (e.g., HC3Z-15K601-AG) matches the vehicle's frequency (902MHz or 315MHz)."

    "BMW 3 Series (2005-2013)": {
        "overview": "The E90/E60 series uses the CAS3 or CAS3+ immobilizer system. Programming requires a specialized tool like Autel XP400 or Xhorse Key Tool Plus to read the EEPROM and generate a key.",
        "preparation": "1. **Tools Required**: Autel IM508/IM608 + XP400 Programmer.\n2. **Stable Voltage**: BMW systems are sensitive to voltage drops during programming. Connect a high-quality battery stabilizer (70A+).\n3. **Internet Connection**: Required for server-side calculation of CAS3+ ISN.",
        "procedure": "1. Connect IM608/IM508 to OBD-II and plug in the XP400 programmer.\n2. Select **BMW -> Automatic Selection -> IMMO Status Scan**.\n3. Perform a **Quick DTC Cleaning** to clear any background errors.\n4. Select **Add Key (Guided)**.\n5. Insert the existing working key into the ignition to read the CAS data.\n6. When prompted, remove the working key and insert it into the **XP400 Programmer** slot to read the key ID.\n7. Insert the **NEW** blank key into the XP400 slot to write the new data.\n8. Finally, insert the new key into the vehicle's ignition slot to finish synchronization.",
        "notes": "💡 **Tip**: If the car has 'Comfort Access', make sure the new key supports it. Non-CA keys will only work when inserted into the slot.\n⚠️ **Warning**: Never disconnect the battery or programmer while the CAS unit is being 'pre-processed'."

        "preparation": "1. **Tools Required**: Autel IM608, AutoProPAD, or Advanced Diagnostics MVP Pro.\n2. **Part Verification**: Most models use the M3N-32337141 FCC ID (315MHz).",
        "procedure": "1. Connect the tool to the OBD-II port.\n2. Select **GM -> Chevrolet -> Silverado -> 2014-2018**.\n3. Select **Remote Learning** or **Immobilizer & Keys**.\n4. **Add Key**: Insert the existing key and turn to 'On' (Engine Off).\n5. The programmer will prompt to insert the NEW key. Follow the on-screen timer (usually 1 minute).\n6. **Remote Pairing**: Press and hold the **LOCK** and **UNLOCK** buttons simultaneously on the new remote until you hear a chime from the dashboard.\n7. Test the remote start and lock/unlock functions.",
        "notes": "💡 **Tip**: Up to 8 keys/remotes can be programmed to one vehicle.\n⚠️ **Warning**: If the vehicle has 'RPO ATH' (Passive Entry), the programming procedure requires a different backend access method."

    "Dodge Ram 1500 (2019-2024)": {
        "overview": "Current generation Ram trucks (DT) feature a Security Gateway Module (SGW). Programming requires a bypass cable to communicate with the vehicle.",
        "preparation": "1. **Tools Required**: Autel IM608 + **SGW Bypass Cable** (12+8 adapter).\n2. **Access**: The SGW module is typically located behind the radio/multimedia screen. You must plug the 12+8 adapter directly into the SGW connectors.\n3. **Key Type**: 4A Chip, Smart Proximity Key.",
        "procedure": "1. Install the 12+8 Bypass Cable behind the radio.\n2. Connect the programmer to the bypass cable and OBD-II.\n3. Select **Dodge -> Manual Selection -> Ram -> 2019-2024**.\n4.

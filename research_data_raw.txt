The Architecture of Automotive Access: A Comprehensive Analysis of Remote Key Frequencies and Configurations (2000–2025)
1. Introduction: The Evolution of Automotive Radio Frequency Identification
The automotive locksmithing industry sits at the intersection of mechanical precision and advanced cryptography. Over the past twenty-five years, the humble car key has metamorphosed from a simple mechanical device into a sophisticated radio frequency (RF) node capable of complex, encrypted communication with a vehicle’s Body Control Module (BCM). For the professional locksmith or database architect constructing a repository of vehicle access data, understanding the nuance of Frequency Commission (FCC) identifiers, operating frequencies, and button configurations is not merely an administrative task—it is the bedrock of operational capability.

This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of North American vehicle remote systems from model years 2000 through 2025. By synthesizing data from FCC filings, OEM parts catalogs, and aftermarket transponder listings, we establish a definitive reference architecture for building a locksmith database. The analysis reveals distinct trends: a consolidation of operating frequencies toward the global standard of 433 MHz, the bifurcation of legacy and modern systems within single model years, and the emergence of electric vehicle (EV) specific functionality that is reshaping button configuration logic.

1.1 The Shift from Simple RKE to Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS)
In the early 2000s, Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) systems were primarily unidirectional. The key fob transmitted a fixed or rolling code to the vehicle to lock or unlock doors. These systems typically operated on the 315 MHz band in North America, a frequency chosen to minimize interference with other civilian radio applications.1 However, the introduction of Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS) systems—commonly known as "Smart Keys" or "Proximity Keys"—fundamentally changed the data requirements for locksmiths.

PEPS systems require a continuous, bi-directional "handshake" between the fob and the vehicle. This necessitates larger batteries, more robust encryption (such as Hitag AES or Texas DST-AES), and often, different operating frequencies to handle the increased data throughput and range requirements. As we examine the data from 2000 to 2025, we observe a clear migration: distinct mechanical keys give way to remote head keys (RHK), which subsequently evolve into the fully integrated smart fobs that dominate the 2020s.

1.2 The Database Schema: Why FCC ID is the Primary Key
A robust locksmith database cannot rely solely on Year, Make, and Model (YMM). The research indicates that YMM lookups are fraught with ambiguity due to mid-cycle refreshes and trim-level variances. The only immutable identifier for a remote transmitter is the FCC ID.
Regulatory Fingerprint: The FCC ID serves as the regulatory fingerprint, confirming the device's operating frequency and power output.2
Cross-Compatibility: Manufacturers often utilize the same transmitter across multiple vehicle lines (e.g., GM’s ubiquitous use of OHT01060512 across Chevrolet, Buick, and GMC).
The "Split Year" Problem: The data highlights critical "split years" where manufacturers produced two versions of the same vehicle simultaneously (e.g., the 2019 Ram 1500 Classic vs. the 2019 Ram 1500 New Body Style). Only the FCC ID—GQ4-53T versus OHT-4882056—can definitively distinguish the required hardware.3
The following sections dissect these technical specifications by manufacturer, integrating precise data points regarding frequency, battery type, and OEM part numbers to form a complete locksmithing dataset.

2. General Motors (Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, Cadillac)
General Motors represents one of the most complex ecosystems for remote key data due to the sheer volume of models and the transition between different OEM suppliers (primarily Strattec and Hella). The analysis of GM data reveals a three-phase evolution: the separate remote era, the flip-key era, and the modern global platform PEPS era.

2.1 The High-Security Flip Key Era (2010–2019)
For nearly a decade, the high-security flip key was the standard for GM's mid-range vehicles. The dominant FCC ID during this period was OHT01060512, manufactured by Strattec and Hella.5
Technical Specifications and Variants
The OHT01060512 remote operates at 315 MHz and utilizes the HU100 keyway, a side-milled "laser cut" blade that offers higher security than the previous Z-keyway. However, a database builder must note that a single FCC ID does not imply a single button configuration.
Button Confusion: The OHT01060512 electronics are used in both 4-button and 5-button configurations.
4-Button: Lock, Unlock, Trunk, Panic (Common on Cruze, Sonic).
5-Button: Lock, Unlock, Remote Start, Trunk, Panic (Common on Malibu, Equinox).
Crucial Distinction: Using a 4-button shell with a 5-button circuit board (or vice versa) works electronically but creates user interface confusion. The database must track the "Button Function" field explicitly.
Data Cluster: GM Flip Keys
Model	Year Range	FCC ID	Frequency	Part Number (OEM)	Battery	Buttons	Notes
Chevrolet Camaro	2010-2016	OHT01060512	315 MHz	13504199	CR2032	5 (L,U,RS,T,P)	Fixed blade early, Switchblade late
Chevrolet Equinox	2010-2017	OHT01060512	315 MHz	13504200	CR2032	5 (L,U,RS,LG,P)	"LG" = Liftgate icon (SUV specific)
Chevrolet Cruze	2011-2016	OHT01060512	315 MHz	13504259	CR2032	5 (L,U,RS,T,P)	"T" = Trunk icon (Sedan specific)
Chevrolet Sonic	2012-2017	OHT01060512	315 MHz	13500221	CR2032	4 (L,U,P,T)	No Remote Start on base models
Source Analysis: The prevalence of the OHT01060512 across differing body styles (Sedan vs SUV) necessitates a "Button Graphic" field in the database. As seen in snippet 5, the listings explicitly distinguish between "Trunk" (Sedan) and "Hatch/Liftgate" (SUV) variants, despite the shared electronic architecture.

2.2 The PEPS Revolution and Frequency Migration (2016–2025)
Around 2016, GM began migrating its Global A platform vehicles to the Global B architecture, necessitating a shift in remote technology. This era is defined by the move from 315 MHz to 433/434 MHz for many models, particularly trucks and luxury vehicles, to align with global standards.
Chevrolet Silverado & GMC Sierra (2019–2024)
The T1 platform trucks (Silverado/Sierra) represent a critical data cluster. The 2019 model year is a split year (LD/Legacy vs. New Body Style), requiring precise identification. The New Body Style utilizes the HYQ1EA smart key.6
Frequency: 434 MHz (Specifically 433.92 MHz).
FCC ID: HYQ1EA.
Part Numbers: 13529632, 13508398.
Button Complexity: The introduction of the power tailgate created a new button requirement.
5-Button Configuration: Lock, Unlock, Remote Start, Power Tailgate, Panic.
Implication: Locksmiths must stock specific inventory for trucks with the power tailgate option. Programming a non-tailgate fob to a truck equipped with the feature will result in a loss of functionality, a critical failure in service provision.7
Chevrolet Equinox & Blazer (2018–2024)
While the trucks moved to 434 MHz, the crossover segment maintained 315 MHz for several years before transitioning, creating a mixed-frequency environment within the same model years across different GM lines.
FCC ID: HYQ4AA.8
Frequency: 315 MHz.
Part Numbers: 13584498, 13529650.
Button Configuration: 5-Button (Lock, Unlock, Remote Start, Liftgate, Panic).
Insight: The visual similarity between the HYQ1EA (434 MHz Truck) and HYQ4AA (315 MHz SUV) fobs is a major pitfall. They share the same physical shell design ("proximity shape"). The database must flag this visual similarity and enforce FCC ID verification to prevent cross-programming attempts that are destined to fail.9

2.3 The "Can" and "Express" Anomalies
Not all GM vehicles adopted high-tech fobs. The commercial van sector (Chevy Express/GMC Savana) retained legacy architecture well into the 2020s.
Vehicle: 2010–2024 Chevrolet Express.
FCC ID: OUC60221 or OUC60270.10
Frequency: 315 MHz.
Technology: Basic RKE (Remote Keyless Entry), not PEPS.
Part Numbers: 20970808, 22953234.
Buttons: 3-Button (Lock, Unlock, Panic) or 4-Button (Lock, Unlock, Cargo Door, Panic).
Relevance: This proves that "model year" is not a proxy for "technology level." A 2024 Chevy Express uses 2008-era key technology, while a 2024 Silverado uses advanced encryption.

3. Ford Motor Company (Ford, Lincoln)
Ford's remote ecosystem distinguishes itself through the aggressive adoption of high-frequency bands for its truck and SUV lines. While most of the industry settled on 315 MHz or 433 MHz, Ford carved out a niche at 902 MHz for its PEPS systems, primarily to achieve the superior range required for remote start functions on large worksites.12

3.1 The F-Series Evolution and the 902 MHz Standard
The Ford F-Series (F-150, F-250 Super Duty) drives the locksmith market due to its sales volume. The transition to the aluminum body in 2015 marked the shift to high-frequency smart keys.
2015–2020 F-150 (P552 Platform)
Smart Key FCC ID: M3N-A2C31243300.13
Frequency: 902 MHz.
Battery: CR2032.
Part Number: 164-R8134.
Configuration: 5-Button (Lock, Unlock, Remote Start, Tailgate, Panic).
2021–2024 F-150 (P702 Platform)
The redesign in 2021 brought a new chassis for the fob and a critical update in battery technology.
Smart Key FCC ID: M3N-A2C93142600.12
Frequency: 902 MHz.
Battery: CR2450.15
Insight: The shift from CR2032 to CR2450 is significant. The CR2450 offers approximately 620mAh capacity compared to the CR2032's ~225mAh. This increase is necessitated by the "always-on" nature of modern PEPS systems and UWB (Ultra-Wideband) functionality used for "Phone as a Key" features, which consume significantly more power than legacy RF systems. A locksmith database must accurately list the battery type to ensure technicians carry the correct replacements stock.

3.2 The Electric Frontier: F-150 Lightning (2022–2024)
The introduction of the F-150 Lightning EV presents a specific data challenge regarding button iconography and functionality.
FCC ID: M3N-A3C054338.17
Part Number: 164-R8304.
Frequency: 315 MHz (Note: Conflict in data snippets. While F-Series generally uses 902 MHz, snippet 18 lists this specific FCC ID. Cross-referencing standard Ford protocols, 902 MHz is typical for PEPS, but the snippet suggests a potential variance or a secondary frequency for specific EV modules. For the database, verifying the exact frequency on the physical remote is recommended, but 315/902 MHz are the Ford standards).
Button Configuration: 5-Button.
Crucial Variation: Instead of a simple "Remote Start" or "Tailgate," the Lightning fob features a "Frunk" (Front Trunk) release button. Using a gas-model F-150 fob on a Lightning will result in incorrect button mapping (e.g., the remote start button might trigger the frunk or do nothing). The database must segregate "Lightning" as a distinct model from "F-150" to capture this hardware difference.19

3.3 The Universal Flip Key (2020–2025)
For non-PEPS vehicles (keyed ignition), Ford has standardized on a highly versatile flip key.
FCC ID: N5F-A08TAA.20
Part Number: 164-R8269.
Frequency: 315 MHz.
Compatibility: This single key covers a massive range of vehicles, acting as a "skeleton key" for inventory management. It fits the 2021-2024 Bronco Sport, 2022-2024 Maverick, 2020-2024 Escape, and 2021-2023 F-150 (XL Trims).
Transponder: Texas 128-bit AES.
Value: For a locksmith database, highlighting high-compatibility parts like this is vital for reducing inventory costs.
Data Cluster: Ford F-Series & SUVs
Model	Years	Key Type	FCC ID	Freq	Battery	Part #
F-150	2015-2020	Smart Key	M3N-A2C31243300	902 MHz	CR2032	164-R8134
F-150	2021-2024	Smart Key	M3N-A2C93142600	902 MHz	CR2450	164-R8166

Escape	2020-2025	Flip Key	N5F-A08TAA	315 MHz	CR2032	164-R8269
Bronco Sport	2021-2024	Flip Key	N5F-A08TAA	315 MHz	CR2032	164-R8269

4. Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota, Lexus)
Toyota's remote architecture is defined by rigid board generation protocols. Unlike other manufacturers where the FCC ID is the primary filter, Toyota requires the locksmith to verify the "Board ID" or chip type ("G" vs "H") to ensure programmability.

4.1 The Camry Case Study: A Microcosm of Evolution
The Camry's evolution from 2012 to 2025 illustrates the progression of Toyota's security layers.
The "G" vs. "H" Chip Era (2012–2017)
Between 2012 and 2017, Toyota utilized Remote Head Keys that looked identical externally but were internally incompatible.
2012–2014: Used the "G" Chip (stamped 'G' on the blade).
2014.5–2017: Shifted to the "H" Chip (stamped 'H' on the blade).22
FCC ID: HYQ12BDM (for H-chip remotes).
Frequency: 315 MHz.
Part Number: 89070-06421.
Database Rule: A locksmith database must include a field for "Blade Stamp" for Toyota vehicles of this era. Attempting to program a G-chip key to an H-chip system will result in immediate failure.
The Smart Key Era (2018–2024)
With the 2018 redesign, the Camry moved exclusively to PEPS on most trims.
FCC ID: HYQ14FBC.24
Board ID: 231451-0351.
Frequency: 314.3 MHz.
Part Number: 89904-06220.
Dual Frequency Operation: Research indicates that these smart keys often transmit on two frequencies (e.g., 312.10 MHz and 314.35 MHz) to mitigate interference and ensure the "handshake" completes even in noisy RF environments.1
The 2025 Generation
For the 2025 model year, Toyota has introduced a new architecture.
FCC ID: HYQ14FBW.26
Part Number: 8990H-AQ010.
Technology: HITAG-AES (4A Chip).
Frequency: 315 MHz.
Compatibility: This is a hard break from the previous generation. The 2025 keys are not backward compatible with 2024 models.

4.2 RAV4 and the Hybrid Factor
The RAV4 (2019–2025) utilizes the HYQ14FLA FCC ID.29
Frequency: 315 MHz.
Part Numbers: 8990H-0R220, 8990H-0R230.
Chip: Texas H-8A.
Hybrid Nuance: Hybrid models (RAV4 Hybrid, RAV4 Prime) often utilize specific part numbers (e.g., 8990H-42690) that feature a blue-haloed Toyota logo. While the internal electronics (HYQ14FLA) may be cross-compatible with gas models, the aesthetic difference matters to vehicle owners.
Button Variance: The database must account for the optional "Power Liftgate" button. Base LE models use a 3-button fob, while XLE/Limited models use a 4-button fob.

5. Honda Motor Company (Honda, Acura)
Honda's primary complexity lies in its "Driver Memory" system. For high-trim vehicles, the remotes are codified as "Driver 1" and "Driver 2," and the vehicle's BCM treats them as distinct components.

5.1 The Accord Frequency Shift
The Honda Accord underwent a radical frequency migration between generations, rendering older inventory obsolete.
2013–2017 Generation: Used FCC ID ACJ932HK1310A operating at 314 MHz.31
2018–2022 Generation: Shifted to FCC ID CWTWB1G0090 operating at 433 MHz.32
Driver 1 Part #: 72147-TVA-A11.
Driver 2 Part #: 72147-TVA-A21.
Implication: A locksmith cannot simply stock "one Accord key." They must stock Driver 1 and Driver 2 variants to support memory seating functions. Programming two "Driver 1" keys may result in the car rejecting the second key or failing to recall specific driver settings.
2023–2024 Generation: The newest models utilize FCC ID KR5TP-4.34
Part Number: 72147-T20-A11.
Frequency: 433 MHz.
Chip: HITAG AES (4A).

5.2 CR-V and HR-V Standardization
The CR-V followed a similar trajectory but introduced the KR5 series of remotes manufactured by Continental.
2017–2022 CR-V: Uses KR5V2X.36
Frequency: 433.92 MHz.
Board ID: V44.
Buttons: 5-Button (Lock, Unlock, Remote Start, Hatch, Panic).
Legacy Systems (HR-V): Older HR-V models (2016-2020) used KR5V1X operating at 313.8 MHz.37 The slight difference in frequency (313.8 vs 433) means these look-alike remotes are completely incompatible.
Data Cluster: Honda/Acura
Model	Years	FCC ID	Frequency	Driver Memory?	Part # (Driver 1)
Accord	2013-2017	ACJ932HK1310A	314 MHz	Yes	72147-T2G-A11
Accord	2018-2022	CWTWB1G0090	433 MHz	Yes	72147-TVA-A11
Accord	2023-2024	KR5TP-4	433 MHz	Yes	72147-T20-A11
CR-V	2017-2022	KR5V2X	433 MHz	Yes	72147-TLA-A11
Civic	2022-2024	KR5TP-4	434 MHz	No	72147-T20-A01

6. Stellantis (Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram)
Stellantis vehicles present a unique challenge due to the longevity of their platforms. The "Fobik" system (FOB Integrated Key) persisted for over a decade, overlapping with newer Proximity systems.

6.1 The Ram 1500 Split: DS vs. DT (2019–2024)
The year 2019 is the single most confusing data point in the Ram lineup. Stellantis produced the "Classic" (DS body) and the "New Body Style" (DT body) simultaneously.
Ram 1500 Classic (DS): Utilizes the legacy architecture.
FCC ID: GQ4-53T.38
Frequency: 433 MHz.
Type: Teardrop-shaped Smart Key or Fobik.
Part Number: 68508721AA.
Ram 1500 New Body (DT): Utilizes the new architecture with a blockier, high-end fob.
FCC ID: OHT-4882056.4
Frequency: 433 MHz.
Part Number: 68291689AA.
Buttons: Up to 7 buttons, including Air Suspension Lowering and Tailgate Release.
Database Rule: A locksmith database must prompt the user to identify "Classic" vs "New Body" for any 2019+ Ram lookup.

6.2 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2 vs. WL)
Similar to the Ram, the Grand Cherokee underwent a platform change that introduced a new key generation.
2014–2021 (WK2 Platform): Used the M3N-40821302 fob.41
Frequency: 433 MHz.
Reliability: This key is known for button pad wear, making it a high-volume replacement item.
2022–2024 (WL Platform): Introduced the M3NWXF0B1 fob.42
Form Factor: Matches the new Grand Wagoneer style—heavier, gloss black finish.
Part Number: 68377529AB.
Buttons: Includes specific configurations for the "L" (Long wheelbase) versions.

6.3 Chrysler Pacifica: The "KeySense" Factor
The Pacifica (2017–2024) introduced a parental control feature embedded in the key itself.
Standard Key FCC ID: M3N-97395900.44
KeySense Key: Uses the same FCC ID but a different Part Number (68238686) and visually features the "KeySense" logo.46
Function: When the vehicle detects the KeySense fob, it enforces speed limits and volume caps.
Inventory Note: A standard key cannot be programmed as a KeySense key, and vice versa. They are distinct logical entities in the BCM.

7. Nissan Motor Corporation (Nissan, Infiniti)
Nissan's remote strategy is characterized by strict BCM locking protocols. Once a modern Nissan smart key is programmed to a vehicle, its transponder chip is irreversibly locked to that VIN (unless "re-flashed" by specialized hardware).

7.1 The Altima Lineage
2013–2015: FCC ID KR5S180144014.47
Issue: This specific generation is notorious for "locking" hard. Used keys cannot be reprogrammed without unlocking software.
2016–2018: Continued using KR5S180144014 but updated the part number to 285E3-9HS4A.48
2019–2024: Transitioned to KR5TXN1.49
Frequency: 433 MHz.
Chip: HITAG AES (4A).
Part Number: 285E3-6CA1A.
2025 Altima: The newest generation uses KR5TXN4.51
Part Number: 285E3-6LS5A.
Compatibility: Despite visual similarities to the TXN1, the TXN4 is electronically distinct and not backward compatible.

8. Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai, Kia)
Hyundai and Kia systems are perhaps the most challenging for database architects because they are highly VIN-specific. Visually identical fobs often have different internal boards based on the production date or assembly plant.

8.1 The Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA) Variance
Modern Hyundai/Kia vehicles (Sonata, K5, Tucson) offer a feature where the car can be moved forward or backward via the key fob (RSPA).
Hyundai Sonata (2020–2023): Uses FCC ID TQ8-FOB-4F27.53
Configuration A: 5-Button (standard remote start).
Configuration B: 7-Button (includes Forward/Backward park assist).
Part Numbers: 95440-L1010 (Standard) vs. 95440-L1060 (RSPA).
Database Requirement: The database must query if the vehicle has the "Parking Assist" package. Providing a standard remote for an RSPA vehicle will disable that premium feature.

8.2 Elantra Evolution
2017–2020: Used CQOFD00120 (434 MHz).54
2021–2024: Shifted to NYOMBEC5FOB2004.55
Part Number: 95440-AA000.
Chip: 6A / HITAG AES.
2025 Update: The 2025 Elantra introduces NYOMBEC7FOB2208.56
Part Number: 95440-AA500.
Significance: This represents a rolling change in security encryption to the newer "MBEC7" protocol, likely to combat relay attacks.

9. Conclusion and Database Recommendations
The construction of a 2000–2025 automotive locksmith database is an exercise in managing complexity. The data indicates a clear industry trajectory toward 433/434 MHz frequencies, CR2450 batteries for high-power applications, and AES-128 encryption.
For the database architect, the following rules are paramount:
FCC ID is the Primary Filter, Part Number is the Validator: Never rely on model year alone.
Split-Year Sensitivity: Flag 2019 (Ram/Silverado) and 2021/2022 (Grand Cherokee/Toyota) as critical verification points.
Button Feature Tracking: Explicitly track "Frunk," "Tailgate," "Remote Park," and "KeySense" attributes, as these dictate the specific Part Number required.
Battery Specs: Include battery data (CR2032 vs CR2450) to support up-selling and proper service.
By structuring data around these pillars, a locksmith database can transform from a simple list of parts into a vital diagnostic tool that prevents programming failures and inventory waste.

The Fortified Chassis: A Comprehensive Analysis of Secure Gateway Architectures in Modern Automotive Networks (2018–2024)
1. Executive Summary: The End of the Open Architecture Era
The automotive industry is currently navigating one of the most profound shifts in its technological history: the transition from open, trust-based internal networks to segmented, authenticated, and encrypted digital architectures. For nearly three decades, the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) port served as a universal, unguarded interface into the vehicle’s central nervous system. Mandated by emissions regulations, this port provided a direct copper pathway to the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, allowing trusted access to critical control units for anyone with a physical connection. This architecture relied entirely on "security by obscurity" and the physical isolation of the vehicle.
However, the proliferation of telematics, 4G/LTE modems, and advanced infotainment systems has irrevocably eroded this physical isolation. Modern vehicles are no longer standalone mechanical entities; they are nodes in a continuously connected IoT ecosystem. This connectivity introduced a new threat vector: remote exploitation. In response, global regulatory bodies and automotive manufacturers have implemented the Secure Gateway (SGW) Module. This device functions as a digital firewall, strictly enforcing an "air gap" between external interfaces and the safety-critical internal networks that control propulsion, braking, and steering.
This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of the Secure Gateway implementations by three major automotive conglomerates: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA/Stellantis), Nissan, and Ford. The analysis focuses on the model years 2018 through 2024, a period that marks the aggressive rollout of these security measures. We dissect the physical and digital bypass mechanisms required to service these vehicles, detailing the precise physical locations of SGW modules in high-volume platforms and analyzing the proprietary connector interfaces that now govern access to the vehicle's brain. The findings indicate that while software-based authentication (e.g., AutoAuth) is the OEM-preferred path for routine diagnostics, physical bypass solutions remain a critical, albeit invasive, necessity for advanced repair, tuning, and locksmithing operations.
2. The Cybersecurity Imperative and Regulatory Landscape
2.1 The Vulnerability of the CAN Bus
To fully appreciate the necessity and function of the Secure Gateway, one must understand the inherent vulnerability of the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol. Developed in the 1980s, CAN was designed for reliability and speed, not security. It operates on a broadcast messaging system where every node on the network trusts every other node implicitly. If a device can send a message on the bus—for example, "Command: Apply Brakes"—the receiving modules (e.g., the ABS pump) will execute that command without verifying the sender's identity.
In the pre-connected era, this was acceptable because gaining access to the CAN bus required physical intrusion into the cabin. However, as vehicles became equipped with cellular modems for navigation, remote start apps, and over-the-air (OTA) updates, the "attack surface" expanded. Researchers demonstrated that if a hacker compromised the infotainment unit (the "Public" side), they could pivot to the CAN bus and send malicious commands to the "Private" side, such as disabling the transmission or controlling the steering. The Secure Gateway Module was introduced to stop this specific lateral movement.1
2.2 The Man-in-the-Middle Architecture
The SGW fundamentally alters the vehicle's topology by acting as a hardware-based Man-in-the-Middle (MITM). It segments the vehicle network into two distinct zones:
The Public Sector: This zone includes the OBD-II Data Link Connector (DLC) and the Telematics/Radio units. These are considered "untrusted" interfaces because they communicate with the outside world.
The Private Sector: This zone includes the Powertrain CAN (PT-CAN), Body CAN (B-CAN), and Chassis CAN (C-CAN). These networks host the critical ECUs and are considered "trusted".1
The SGW sits between these two zones. There is no longer a direct copper wire connecting the OBD-II port to the Engine Control Unit. Instead, the OBD-II port connects solely to the SGW. All diagnostic requests must pass through the SGW processor. The module evaluates every packet against an Access Control List (ACL). If a generic scan tool requests "Read Data" (e.g., engine RPM, coolant temperature, or DTCs), the SGW permits the traffic, as this poses no safety risk. However, if the tool attempts a "Write" operation—such as clearing trouble codes, actuating a solenoid, or programming a key—the SGW blocks the request unless the tool provides a valid cryptographic certificate.1
2.3 Regulatory Drivers: UN R155 and ISO 21434
While manufacturer self-interest drives some of this security, the primary catalyst is global regulation. The United Nations Regulation No. 155 (UN R155) mandates that vehicle manufacturers must manage cyber risks and ensure vehicles are secure by design. Similarly, the ISO/SAE 21434 standard provides the framework for cybersecurity engineering. These regulations effectively force OEMs to implement gateways to prove they have mitigated the risk of remote attacks. Consequently, what began with FCA in 2018 has now spread to Nissan, Ford, and practically every other major manufacturer, creating a standardized yet fragmented landscape of "walled gardens" that the aftermarket must navigate.
3. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (Stellantis): The Security Pioneer
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), now part of Stellantis, was the first major OEM to implement a fleet-wide firewall. Starting with select 2018 models and achieving near-total saturation by 2019/2020, the FCA Secure Gateway (SGW) became the prototype for the industry's approach to locking down the OBD-II port.2 The FCA implementation is characterized by its reliance on a specific third-party authentication service (AutoAuth) and the widespread use of a specific physical connector standard known as the "12+8" system.
3.1 The Digital Solution: AutoAuth
The "official" method for bypassing the FCA SGW is purely digital. FCA partnered with a third-party service called AutoAuth to manage the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) required for tool authentication.
The Workflow: A technician registers their shop and their individual scan tool serial numbers with AutoAuth. When the internet-connected scan tool is plugged into a 2018+ FCA vehicle, it detects the SGW. The tool then communicates via Wi-Fi to the AutoAuth server, which verifies the technician's credentials. If valid, the server sends a digital token back to the tool, which presents it to the vehicle's SGW. The SGW then "unlocks," permitting bidirectional controls and code clearing.3
Limitations: While seamless in theory, AutoAuth requires a continuous internet connection, a paid annual subscription (typically /year per shop), and a compatible, up-to-date scan tool.3 For independent locksmiths working in underground garages, mobile mechanics in poor signal areas, or enthusiasts using older hardware, this digital path is often viable. This limitation necessitates the physical bypass.
3.2 The Physical Solution: The 12+8 Bypass
The "12+8 Bypass" is a hardware workaround that physically subverts the SGW logic. Since the SGW is essentially a router sitting between the OBD port and the CAN bus, the bypass involves unplugging the network cables from the SGW and connecting them directly to each other (or to the scan tool), effectively removing the SGW from the circuit.
The Hardware: The bypass typically utilizes a Y-cable or a specialized breakout block. The name "12+8" refers to the pin counts of the two connectors used by the SGW: a 12-pin connector and an 8-pin connector.
The Logic: The 12-pin connector typically carries the "Private" CAN bus lines (e.g., CAN-C) from the vehicle. The 8-pin connector typically carries the lines from the OBD-II port. By bridging these directly, the technician creates a continuous loop, restoring the pre-2018 "open" architecture. This allows any non-networked or older scan tool to function with full authority, as there is no module left to say "no".1
3.3 Detailed SGW Module Locations and Access Procedures
The primary challenge of the physical bypass is locating the SGW. FCA engineers have placed these modules in diverse locations across different platforms, often burying them deep within the dashboard infrastructure to discourage tampering.
3.3.1 Ram 1500 Ecosystem (DS vs. DT Platforms)
The Ram 1500 lineup presents a unique dichotomy due to the concurrent production of two different generations: the "Classic" (DS body code) and the "New Body Style" (DT body code). The SGW location differs radically between these two, causing significant confusion in the field.
A. Ram 1500 "New Body Style" (DT, 2019–2024)
Location: The SGW is located in the driver's side footwell area, positioned distinctively away from the center stack. It is mounted vertically on the metal dashboard support structure, located roughly above the parking brake pedal mechanism and behind the headlight switch cluster.
Visual Identification: It is a black rectangular box, approximately 4x5 inches.
Access Procedure:
Posture: The technician must adopt a contorted position, lying on the floorboard looking upward into the dash.
Removal: No trim removal is strictly necessary, though it is extremely tight. The module is often obscured by the main wire harness bundle.
Connector Interaction: The 12-pin and 8-pin connectors are plugged into the bottom or side of the module. The locking tabs must be depressed blindly.
Bypass Installation: Once unplugged, the vehicle's harness connectors are plugged into the male ends of the 12+8 bypass cable. The diagnostic tool then plugs into the OBD port on the bypass cable, not the dashboard.6
B. Ram 1500 "Classic" (DS, 2018–2022)
Location: The SGW is buried directly behind the infotainment/radio head unit in the center dashboard stack. This location reflects the older electrical architecture where the radio was the primary "public" vector.
Access Procedure:
Trim Removal: The process begins with removing the rubber tray liner in the upper dash storage bin to reveal two T20 Torx screws.
Bezel Removal: The entire radio bezel (often including the climate controls) must be pried off. It is held by robust metal retaining clips that require a non-marring pry tool to avoid dashboard damage.
Radio Removal: Four 7mm screws secure the radio receiver. The radio must be pulled forward.
Module Access: The SGW is bolted to the black plastic sub-structure directly behind the void left by the radio.6
Implications: This is a labor-intensive procedure (20–30 minutes) compared to the DT model. It makes "quick scans" via physical bypass highly inefficient, strongly incentivizing the use of AutoAuth for this specific model.
3.3.2 Jeep Wrangler JL (2018+) and Gladiator JT (2020+)
Location: The module is located under the driver's side dashboard, to the left of the steering column. It is often mounted near the Body Control Module (BCM) and the gateway to the chassis harness.
Access Challenges: While physically closer to the driver than in the Ram DS, the connectors are notoriously difficult to unplug. The module is often oriented such that the locking tabs face the firewall or are blocked by other harnesses.
The "Extension" Phenomenon: Due to the difficulty of reaching these plugs (and the pain of scratching hands on metal brackets), a common modification in the Jeep community is the installation of "12+8 Extension Cables." These short patch cables are installed once (often requiring significant effort or minor disassembly of the lower knee bolster) and then left dangling in the footwell. This provides a permanent, easily accessible "bypass port" for future diagnostics without needing to fight the factory connector retention clips again.9
Access Procedure:
Remove the plastic panel directly below the steering column (held by clips).
Reach up and to the left.
Identify the two white connectors plugged into the black module.
Depress the tabs and pull downwards.11
3.3.3 Chrysler Pacifica (2017/2018+)
Location: The SGW is located in the center stack "waterfall" area, typically behind the climate control module or the rotary gear selector assembly.
Access Procedure:
The lower trim bezel containing the HVAC controls must be removed. This is usually a clip-in fitment.
Once the bezel is popped out, the module is visible mounted deep in the cavity.
Alternative Access: Some technicians report success reaching up from the driver's footwell toward the center of the car to unplug the connectors blindly, though this requires precise knowledge of the module's orientation.12
3.3.4 Dodge Charger and Challenger (2018+)
Location: The location varies slightly by year and trim but is generally found under the driver's side dash, often near the steering column support or the "Double Bracket" area.
Variant Note: Certain sources suggest that on specific high-trim models with advanced Uconnect systems, the module may be located closer to the radio, necessitating the removal of the large dashboard bezel that surrounds both the cluster and the radio (the "racetrack" bezel). Verification of the specific VIN is recommended before attempting disassembly.14
3.4 Technical Reference: FCA 12+8 Connector Morphology
Understanding the physical attributes of the connectors is vital for technicians attempting blind removal in tight spaces.
12-Pin Connector:
Function: Primary interface for the "Private" vehicle networks (CAN-C) and power supply.
Pinout Configuration: Dual-row layout (2 rows x 6 pins).
Visuals: White or Off-White nylon housing.
Locking Mechanism: A single, firm depression tab located on the top center of the connector body.
Wire Colors (Typical): Red/Yellow (12V Constant), Black (Ground), White/Green (CAN-C High), White/Blue (CAN-C Low). Note: Wire colors can vary by model year; pin position is the reliable standard.
8-Pin Connector:
Function: Interface for the "Public" networks (CAN-IHS) and the OBD-II port communication lines.
Pinout Configuration: Dual-row layout (2 rows x 4 pins).
Visuals: Matching White/Off-White nylon housing.
Locking Mechanism: Top center tab.
Common Failure Points: The locking tabs are prone to becoming brittle. In "blind" removal scenarios, technicians often use a pick tool to depress the tab, which carries a risk of snapping the lock or damaging the wire retention mechanism.1
4. Nissan: The Integrated Gateway and the "Silent" Block
While FCA's SGW is a loud and obvious barrier—often throwing "Communication Error" messages immediately—Nissan's approach is more subtle and integrated. Following the implementation of UN R155, Nissan began rolling out its secured architecture with the 2020 Nissan Sentra (B18) and the 2021 Nissan Rogue (T33). Unlike FCA's standalone box, Nissan's security logic is often embedded within the Central Gateway (CGW) or the Body Control Module (BCM), making "removal" impossible. Instead, the bypass relies on intercepting signals at the connector level.
4.1 Architecture: The 16+32 System
The Nissan system is colloquially known in the aftermarket as the 16+32 Gateway due to the pin count of the primary connectors involved in the bypass.
32-Pin Connector: This high-density connector typically handles the primary communication traffic, including the High-Speed CAN lines that link the BCM to the ECU and the Intelligent Power Distribution Module (IPDM).
16-Pin Connector: This connector manages auxiliary bus traffic and secondary signals.
4.2 The Bypass Distinction: Diagnostics vs. Immobilizer
A critical nuance in the Nissan ecosystem is the difference in security levels between standard diagnostics and key programming.
Standard Diagnostics: For routine tasks like reading Check Engine lights or viewing live data parameters, many modern scan tools (Autel, Launch, Snap-on) can authenticate with the Nissan gateway over the internet (via AutoAuth or similar OEM protocols) without requiring any physical cable. The gateway allows these "Read" operations more permissively.4
Immobilizer (IMMO) / Key Programming: This is where the physical bypass becomes mandatory. On the B18 Sentra and T33 Rogue, the gateway actively blocks the retrieval of the PIN Code (a 20-digit security code required to program new keys) during an "All Keys Lost" or "Add Key" scenario. Even with online authentication, the gateway often refuses to release this PIN to aftermarket tools.
The 16+32 Cable Solution: To circumvent this, the technician must use a "Nissan 16+32 Gateway Adapter." This cable connects in-line (or as a complete bypass) between the vehicle's harness and the scan tool. It physically intercepts the CAN lines before they enter the restrictive logic of the BCM/Gateway, allowing the tool to query the immobilizer data directly from the network without the Gateway filtering the request.16
4.3 Detailed Locations and Access Procedures
4.3.1 Nissan Sentra (B18 Chassis, 2020–2024)
Target Module: The security logic is housed in the BCM/Gateway cluster.
Location: The module is located under the driver's side dashboard, positioned high up near the firewall, typically above the brake pedal assembly.
Access Procedure:
Trim Removal: Remove the driver's side door sill plate and the kick panel trim.
Dash Panel: Remove the lower dashboard cover (knee bolster) to gain visibility.
Visual ID: Look for a rectangular black box with multiple connectors. The 32-pin and 16-pin connectors are often adjacent.
Connection: The space is notoriously tight. Technicians often report having to lay supine in the footwell to reach the connectors. The bypass cable is plugged into the vehicle harness connectors (which are unplugged from the module), effectively isolating the module from the tool's query path.18
4.3.2 Nissan Rogue (T33 Chassis, 2021–2024)
The Rogue (and the mechanically similar Mitsubishi Outlander, 2022+) presents a different location that has caused confusion in early documentation.
Target Module: Gateway/Smart Key ECU.
Location: The access point is behind the glovebox on the passenger side. This is distinct from the Sentra's driver-side location.
Access Procedure:
Glovebox Removal: The glovebox assembly must be removed. This typically involves opening the glovebox and removing the dampener arm (a string or plastic piston) on the right side.
Screws: There are usually 5 to 8 Phillips-head screws securing the glovebox frame to the dashboard: typically three along the bottom edge (visible with the glovebox closed) and three to five along the top edge (visible only when the glovebox is open).
Removal: Once unscrewed, the entire glovebox compartment pulls straight out.
Module Identification: Behind the glovebox, mounted to the metal cross-car beam or the HVAC ducting support, is the module rack. The Gateway/BCM connectors (16+32 style) are accessible here.
Advisory: This location is generally considered easier to access than the Sentra's kick panel, as it allows for working from a seated position (passenger seat) rather than the footwell contortion.19
4.4 Technical Reference: Nissan 16+32 Connector Morphology
32-Pin Connector:
Housing: Typically Gray or Black.
Shape: Rectangular, elongated.
Density: High-density pin layout (2 rows x 16 pins).
Wire Gauge: Mixed. Mostly thin signal wires (20-22 AWG) with a few slightly thicker power wires at the edges.
16-Pin Connector:
Housing: Matches the 32-pin in color.
Shape: Shorter rectangle.
Pin Configuration: 2 rows x 8 pins.
Bypass Cable Note: The male pins on the aftermarket 16+32 adapters are often long and thin. A common failure mode is "bent pins" during insertion. Technicians are advised to inspect the adapter pins for straightness before attempting to mate them with the vehicle's female harness connectors.21
5. Ford: The CAN-FD Frontier and the Active Alarm Paradox
Ford's entry into the secured architecture era is marked by the introduction of the FNV2 (Ford Network Vehicle 2) electrical architecture, debuting largely with the 2021 Ford F-150 and the Mustang Mach-E. This architecture is a quantum leap from previous iterations, utilizing CAN-FD (Flexible Data-rate) protocol to handle the massive data throughput required for Over-the-Air (OTA) updates and advanced driver-assistance systems (BlueCruise).
5.1 The CAN-FD Barrier
The first "barrier" technicians encounter with 2021+ Fords is not always a security firewall, but a protocol incompatibility. The CAN-FD protocol operates at variable data rates (up to 5 Mbps or higher) and supports payload sizes up to 64 bytes (compared to standard CAN's 8 bytes).
The Symptom: Older OBD-II tools that only support standard CAN 2.0 will fail to communicate with the vehicle modules, appearing as if the gateway is blocking them.
The Solution: This is not a "bypass" issue but a hardware issue. Technicians must use a CAN-FD Adapter (supported by Autel, Launch, Topdon) that acts as a translator, or upgrade to newer tools with native CAN-FD support. The Gateway Module (GWM) expects this protocol; without it, the conversation never starts.22
5.2 The Active Alarm / All Keys Lost (AKL) Problem
For locksmiths, the Ford FNV2 architecture introduced a formidable challenge known as the "Active Alarm Lockdown."
The Scenario: In an "All Keys Lost" situation, the vehicle is locked, and the factory alarm is armed. On previous generations, a locksmith could plug into the OBD port and initiate a 10-minute security wait time to bypass the alarm.
The Security Logic: On 2021+ models (F-150, Mach-E, Explorer), if the alarm is active, the GWM and BCM effectively shut down the OBD port's ability to initiate key programming. The vehicle assumes any attempt to program a key while the alarm is screaming is a theft attempt.
The Limitation: You cannot simply clear the alarm because you have no working key. It is a catch-22.
5.3 The Physical Solution: The Battery Cable Bypass
To break this loop, the aftermarket (specifically companies like Xhorse and Autel) developed a bypass cable that attacks the power source rather than the data bus.
The Logic: The bypass cable connects directly to the vehicle's 12V battery and the diagnostic tool. It does not plug into the GWM inside the dash. Instead, it manipulates the vehicle's power state—likely by creating a specific "wake-up" signal or power cycling sequence that forces the BCM into a "maintenance" or "pre-boot" state where the alarm logic is temporarily suspended, allowing the OBD tool to shake hands with the immobilizer.
The Connection Procedure:
Disconnect Negative: The technician must disconnect the negative terminal of the vehicle's 12V battery.
Install Bypass Clamp: The bypass cable's negative clamp connects to the vehicle's disconnected negative cable.
Bridge to Battery: The bypass cable also connects to the battery's positive and negative posts, effectively sitting in-line with the vehicle's power supply.
Result: The tool (e.g., Autel IM608 or Xhorse Key Tool Plus) manages the power flow, cycling the ignition state electronically to bypass the alarm trigger.23
5.4 GWM Module Locations and Access (Non-Battery Methods)
For tasks other than key programming—such as recovering a "bricked" module after a failed OTA update or performing rigorous diagnostics—direct access to the Gateway Module (GWM) connectors is sometimes required to hook up specialized harnesses (like the Mongoose-Plus).
5.4.1 Ford F-150 (2021+)
Location: The GWM is located in the lower center stack, physically positioned below the radio unit.
Access Procedure:
Lower Trim: Remove the screws securing the lower center stack trim panel (often six 7mm screws).25
Side Trim: Remove the two 10mm screws securing the side panels of the center console to gain clearance.
Module Exposure: With the trim removed, the GWM is visible. It is a large module with multiple connectors (typically 3 or 4, depending on trim level).
Connector Interaction: The connectors here are 26-pin variants designed for the high-speed FNV2 network. Unplugging these allows for the insertion of "T-harnesses" used by fleet telematics installers or deep-level diagnostic tools.25
5.4.2 Ford Mustang Mach-E (2021+)
Challenge: The Mach-E, being an EV, has a different packaging layout.
Location: The Smart Data Link Module (GWM) is deeply integrated into the dashboard infrastructure.
Fuse Bypass: For resetting a glitchy gateway (a common troubleshooting step), technicians often rely on pulling the GWM fuse located in the Body Control Module fuse box (Passenger footwell) rather than physically accessing the buried module.26
EV Battery Caution: When performing the "Active Alarm" battery bypass on a Mach-E, technicians must be acutely aware that the 12V battery is located in the "frunk" (front trunk). If the 12V system is dead, the electronic latch to open the frunk will not operate. The technician must first use the emergency release access cover in the front bumper to jump the latch solenoid, open the hood, and then proceed with the battery cable bypass.27
6. Diagnostic Workflow: Choosing the Right Access Method
The complexity of modern vehicle security means there is no "one size fits all" tool. Technicians must employ a decision logic to determine the most efficient access path.
6.1 Diagnostic Decision Logic
The choice between software (AutoAuth/OEM Cloud) and hardware (Bypass Cable) depends largely on the specific task and the vehicle manufacturer.
Scenario A: Routine Diagnostics (Read/Clear Codes, Live Data)
FCA: AutoAuth is the superior choice. It is faster (no disassembly) and supports all modules. The physical bypass is a fallback for when the internet is unavailable or the subscription is expired.
Nissan: Standard OBD-II (often with Cloud support) usually suffices. The 16+32 cable is rarely needed for simple code clearing.
Ford: Standard OBD-II (with CAN-FD adapter) is sufficient.
Scenario B: Advanced Repair (Bidirectional Control, Calibrations)
FCA: AutoAuth works for 95% of tasks. However, some ECU tuning or odometer correction tools may still require the physical 12+8 cable to write directly to the EEPROM without SGW interference.
Nissan: Standard OBD-II typically works, but some specific active tests may require the 16+32 cable if the gateway security logic is particularly aggressive on that specific software version.
Scenario C: Key Programming (IMMO / All Keys Lost)
FCA: 12+8 Cable is frequently preferred or required by locksmith tools (like the Autel IM508/608) to ensure uninterrupted communication with the RF Hub.
Nissan: 16+32 Cable is Mandatory for 2020+ Sentra and Rogue. The gateway will block the PIN code read request without it.
Ford: Active Alarm Cable (Battery connection) is Mandatory for AKL situations on 2021+ F-150/Mach-E. The OBD port is functionally dead for programming while the alarm is active.

7. Implications for the Aftermarket
The data clearly indicates a shift in the balance of power between OEMs and the independent aftermarket. The Secure Gateway is not merely a component; it is a policy enforcement device. While the "Right to Repair" movement has secured access to the data (via generic OBD modes), the ability to act on that data—to fix, to tune, to program—is now gated.
For the independent shop, this necessitates a capital investment not just in tools, but in subscriptions and time. The "quick code clear" that once took 30 seconds on a Ram 1500 now takes 30 minutes if the AutoAuth server is down and the radio bezel must be pulled. For the locksmith, the 16+32 and Active Alarm cables are now as essential as the key cutting machine itself.
Ultimately, the Secure Gateway has standardized the need for a "Hybrid" toolkit: a technician in 2024 cannot rely solely on a physical connection or a digital credential. They must possess both, and the knowledge of when to deploy each, to navigate the fortified chassis of the modern connected vehicle.
